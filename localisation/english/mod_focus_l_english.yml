The fate of the Union hanged in the balance as only leadership of the GKChP stopped it from falling over the edge. But now, 9 years later the situation is no better than before, except, now there are no more Yeltsins or Gorbachevs to take the blame."

Sure, there are no “big” signs of any problems with the economy, but the stagnation of productivity, Union's isolation from the world trade, half-cocked reversal of the economy after Perestroika and Yanayev's unsuccessful 1996 reforms have left a significant impact on the Soviet economic sector.\n\n§RThe only question is - How long can we keep it this way?§!"

 SOV_yazov_problem_desc:0"Sure, Sure, Gorbachev is the new leader of the Soviet Union, but he hasn't completely eliminated his rivals...yet.

 SOV_civ_ind:0 "Focus on Civilian Sector"

 SOV_ind_cit:0 "Expand the Industrial Cities"
 SOV_ind_cit_desc:0"Moscow, Volgograd, Leningrad ... All these cities have two things in common ... The devotion to the Communist cause and the Great Industrialization. If we invest in these areas we will improve the Union's situation, at least by a bit."
 SOV_civ_sect:0 "Expand the Civilian Sector"

The main one being that he was always the man who would be called to "solve the problems". This type of job has given him the pure hate from the reformist and more liberal cliques in the Party who were the targets most of the time. Still, his reputation as one of a capable man for the job who devoted himself to the orders and Soviet apparatus may not be entirely true as he is well known to be one of the most corrupt members of the said apparatus.\n\nThe road to the top has not been the cleanest one but there's still a long way to go..."

 SOV_put_conspiracy:0 "The Great Conspiracy"
 SOV_put_conspiracy_desc:0"Something is not right, things are too off for it to be considered a coincidence, there is dissent, disobedience, and there are traitors amongst the ranks, and Putin knows this all too well. Whether it be the hardliner Zyuganovites who are like parasites in his garden, or the mischievous LDPR members who plot behind his back, or even the members in his own faction, even they contain dissenters. The only ones Putin can truly trust as of now are the truly commendable patriots of the Motherland, the KGB, who not only have served the Union time and time again, but are the only cure to this disease killing the Grand Soviet State. Some may call him mad for thinking there are this many traitors, some worry this will reflect the purges of Stalin, to Putin, it doesn't matter what they say, all that matters is that this so called “Great Conspiracy” ends only with the utter destruction of the criminals who dare to betray the Motherland."

How could anyone within his party not see how Zyuganov, this Judas in a suit, was scheming in order to overthrow the Upper Soviet and implement his twisted visions of Communism onto the Union. Putin had to deal with this one way or another, and with the KGB by his side, he would smoke out these vermin in disguise and restore the gleaming ideals of Communism. A couple of arrests here, some wiretaps there, and even some poisonings oughta do it, it won't be easy due to their influence, but in the end, the Hardliner faction within the Soviets will soon be a passing memory, a grant example of what happens when you wrong Putin and Mother Russia."

He can see it, the mistrust, the corruption, it reeks like sewage, and Putin would have to be the cleaner, with the KGB being his tools.\n\nThis would be the most important party investigation as, in order for his government to function, the center faction must hold at all costs, and it will hold, with its allegiance to Putin, that is."
 SOV_put_eyes_on_right:0 "All Eyes on the Right"
 SOV_put_eyes_on_right_desc:0"The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is not Liberal, not Democratic, and hell they aren't even a real party, but they managed to become powerful enough to the point that they are now considered a threat to Putin’s interests. We have vanquished the scourge of fascism off the face of the planet before, around the world the USSR was considered the gallows to the fascists, where Fritz was burned in Berlin and the Japs were smashed in Harbin, yet now the spirit of their evils lurks within our own people. Granted this new nationalist cause is nowhere near as extreme, at least that's what Putin says, but still they cannot be fully trusted and, much like the ghoulish Zyuganovites, these schemers must face the hammer of justice. Luckily this will not be as difficult as compared to cracking down on the Hardliners due to their lower influence, so our friends in the KGB will have a much easier time in cleaning up not only these notorious nationalists."

For the sake of the Union and the Motherland Putin must act, but how? The simplest of these moves would be switching out the KGB as a source of suppression of rivals with the Soviet Army instead, surely they would put an end to the traitors once and for all. However it doesn't go without risks, as there will be chaos in the streets, vicious fighting across the Union, and maybe even a civil war could be caused, obviously this is the riskiest path. The other option is to give a nod to peace and work things out more diplomatically. We can utilize our influence within the government to solidify our power base and put an end to the contentious situation without the bloodshed."

Lukashenko has proposed a plan for a unified state of Russia and Belarus, or as some call it "Mini USSR", but on the other hand, many within the government in Moscow have urged that this proposal will have a potential of escalating tensions between other SSRs as well as become a ground for conflict between Belarussian opposition and the Moscow government. "
 SOV_put_union_state_solution:0 "Union State Solution"
 SOV_put_union_state_solution_desc:0"This “Union State Solution”, to simplify, will most likely be one of our last moves to expand our territory by the time Putin's plans for the USSR are completed, as this would have the Russian SSR and the Belorussian SSR be in a union between themselves once the Soviet Unions is dissolved. Belarus will not be fully integrated however, they will be given a certain amount of autonomy, but overall they will still be very closely bonded to our nation. It seems Putin's good judgment, influence, along with Lukashenko's favorability towards him has paid off in what looks now to be an even closer bond between these socialist Slavic powers. While this is good news in the long term, it also acts as a foreshadowing for the end of our socialist state, an end coming closer and closer upon the horizon. Whether we are ready to dissolve or not, we will see in the future, but at least we have our friends in Minsk struggling with us."

This will closely bond our states in trade, diplomacy, along with preventing further ethnic or independence chaos around the area. While our full ambitions with the Minsk government have not been achieved, we can look at a sort of “Plan B” with Belorussia in our cordial friendship across the Dnieper."

 SOV_put_agitators_desc:0"While Union's heads agree that a peaceful dissolution is the only way forward, there still exist many that don't agree, or even those who agree but with visions different from the ones that will be put upon the new countries.\n\nThis is where the KGB and the Ministry of Internal Security take to the stage and ensure that Union's stability is kept safe one last time.

These saboteurs, hardliners, liberals, nationalists are an open threat to everything we pulled of so far, and we shall not allow them to destroy it over night.\n\nEverything must be done to make sure Russia's future is kept as safe as possible, thus the Operational Plan "Strela" was conied up. It includes operations of Ministry of Internal Security, KGB and MVD that will remove any and all that stand in the way of Union's peaceful dissolution and Russia's future."

Keeping a socialist model similar to the Chinese one might prove to be a more risky strategy in terms of the economy, but it won't anger millions of people who have known nothing but the words of Marx and Lenin their entire lives.\n\nOn the other hand however, direct transition to a capitalist, oligarchic country will secure the influx of foreign capital into the country, but this also means that we will have to turn our politics to the ever rising nationalist element of the governemnt."

This of course, calls onto implementation of Chinese style socialism and preservation of Union's legacy for the sake of stability and ensuring the future of our people. While this type of socialism diverges from the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, it is our best bet at surviving in this hostile World.\n\nOf course, the revolutionary past of the Union must remain intact if we are to ensure the survival of our socialist state."
 SOV_put_red_oligarchy:0 "A Red Oligarchy"
 SOV_put_red_oligarchy_desc:0"All are equal, but some more than others...\n\nWhile we move forward to transitioning the Russian SSR into a new socialist country, we must realize that the original ideas of Marx and Lenin are not yet ready for this world. To assure our country's transition from the USSR is as painless as possible, we must implement reforms within our socialist economic system. This includes the adaptations of market economy and the somewhat more tolerant acceptance of the richer ruling class. Similar to China, we shall utilize these elements of the market economy to ensure our long term goal of accumulating productive forces."

With approval ratings as low as 39% by some estimates, Quayle’s Presidency hasn’t done much to try and fix that issue; raising new taxes at the height of the recession, sending troops overseas once more to ensure our position in the Middle East, and generally being a very quiet, almost reserved public official--mostly on account of Quayle’s various, growing health concerns.

All ethnic Kurds in Iraq will be oppressed, and any rebels will be exterminated until the Kurds integrate perfectly in Iraq, or that they disappear completely from it. Thanks to this action Saddam has increased his consensus among Iraqi Nationalists."

 IRQ_grant_partial_autonomy:0 "Grant Partial Autonomy"
 IRQ_grant_partial_autonomy_desc:0 "Although no doubt a betrayal in the eyes of Iraqi nationalists, the solution to the Kurdish issue is perhaps the most obvious one: autonomy.

 IRQ_launch_special_operation:0 "Launch Special Operation"
 IRQ_launch_special_operation_desc:0 "The Kurdish factions have now been sufficiently weakened. Too busy squabbling with each other, and distracted by the strategic stalling of our diplomats, they have failed to notice the infiltration of their territories by our special forces.

 IRQ_rebuild_iraqi_navy_desc:0 "Unlike the great powers abroad, the naval history of our nation is brief and fleeting. Our small coastal force has often been no match for any adversary, being completely destroyed twice in the past two decades. While some people might say a third attempt is foolish, we must remember that whoever controls the Persian Gulf, controls the trade through it."
 IRQ_expand_domestic_dockyards:0 "Expand Domestic Dockyards"
 IRQ_expand_domestic_dockyards_desc:0 "Perhaps the biggest flaw in our past ventures into the sea was our complete reliance on foreign powers, either restricting our foreign policy or taking a chunk out of our military budget. Likely the most overt example was the confiscation of the four frigates and six corvettes that we purchased from Italy, which were never delivered following the Gulf War. It is finally time to invest in our own shipyards, instead of channeling money towards foreign powers that are under no real obligation to deliver on any promises."
 IRQ_purchase_foreign_ships:0 "Purchase Foreign Ships"
 IRQ_purchase_foreign_ships_desc:0 "There is a reason why countries buy ships from well-established shipbuilders: they're efficient, effective, and proven. We cannot afford to waste years building up designers and shipyards, with no guarantee that the product we'll produce will be suitable for our needs. Instead, our allies will be able to deliver the vessels we need, while we are better off focusing on other matters."
 IRQ_contest_no-fly_zone:0 "Contest No-fly Zone"
 IRQ_contest_no-fly_zone_desc:0 "The no-fly zones proclaimed by the coalition forces prevent our air force from operating over substantial parts of Iraq.

 IRQ_construct_air_defenses:0 "Construct Air Defenses"
 IRQ_construct_air_defenses_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our air force is no match against the coalition forces, being beaten in both quantity and quality. However, as countless wars have proven, potent air defenses can deter even the most deadly air force.

 IRQ_legacy_mohammed_rayyan:0 "Legacy of Mohammed Rayyan"
 IRQ_legacy_mohammed_rayyan_desc:0 "During the Iran-Iraq War, Mohammed Rayyan was one of our most deadly pilots, scoring at least five air combat kills against Iranian aircraft. His incredible skill gave him access to the MiG-25, the rapid interceptor guarded by Soviet advisors that only allowed the best of the best to fly it. Unfortunately tragedy struck in 1986, when he was shot down by one of Iran’s aces, Jalil Zandi.\n\nThis story should serve to inspire our current generation of pilots, who are used to cowering away from the coalition aircraft that used to patrol our skies. It is through boldness and determination that our air force has survived, and how it will continue to prosper in the years to come."
 IRQ_regular_sorties:0 "Regular Sorties"
 IRQ_regular_sorties_desc:0 "One of the key indicated of a well-trained air force is the number of flight hours a pilot receives per year. After all, there is no better way to train a pilot than to test his skills in real conditions. We must ramp up the number of sorties performed by our air force, which will allow us to both train our pilots and master the logistics behind high-intensity operations."
 IRQ_aircraft_acquisition:0 "Aircraft Acquisition"
 IRQ_aircraft_acquisition_desc:0 "Our air force is severely lacking in aircraft, with a significant portion being lost during the Gulf War and the years following it.

 IRQ_soviet_training:0 "Soviet Training"
 IRQ_soviet_training_desc:0 "Ever since the late 1950s, the Soviet Union has operated a training center for foreign pilots: the 5th Training Center in Frunze. This allows for Soviet-friendly nations to send their best pilots for training, which provides them with modern tactics, skills, and aircraft. With our own skies being under constant watch by coalition forces, and our aircraft largely decades out of date, sending our pilots to the Soviets will no doubt be of great benefit to us."
 IRQ_desert_camouflage:0 "Desert Camouflage"
 IRQ_desert_camouflage_desc:0 "Unlike other armies, we do not have the luxury of operating under friendly skies. We cannot rely on our pilots to shield us from enemy attackers, and therefore we must make sure they never see us in the first place. Camouflage can buy valuable time by disorientating enemy pilots, which is often enough to save our units on the ground."
 IRQ_reform_iraqi_army:0 "Reform the Iraqi Army"
 IRQ_reform_iraqi_army_desc:0 "The Iraqi Army makes up the backbone of our armed forces, bearing the brunt of combat in any potential conflict. However despite its important role, it is poorly equipped and trained, with funding often being misappropriated and high ranks being filled with loyal puppets instead of competent commanders. It is time to perform a purge of the high command, and conduct a reform of the entire system."
 IRQ_increase_monetary_incentives:0 "Increase Monetary Incentives"
 IRQ_increase_monetary_incentives_desc:0 "Unlike the patriotic and capable armies of our neighbours, our army is filled with unmotivated conscripts. In any serious conflict, their lack of willingness to fight will freeze our entire system, and cripple even our loyal and capable Republican Guard. With excess money from the previous reform, we can raise the salaries of our conscripts, providing them with the financial incentive to be on their best performance."
 IRQ_prioritise_republican_guard:0 "Prioritise the Republican Guard"
 IRQ_prioritise_republican_guard_desc:0 "Our traditional army is weak, corrupt, and unmotivated. Relying on them for any major offensive or defensive operations would be a mistake, with their performance in both the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War being subpar at best. Instead, we must invest into our loyal Republican Guard, which consists of our most elite troops outfitted with the best weapons we have to offer."
 IRQ_loyal_army_of_saddam:0 "The Loyal Army of Saddam"
 IRQ_loyal_army_of_saddam_desc:0 "As any autocrat knows, the loyalty and strength of their military is the lifeline of their regime.

 IRQ_lessons_from_desert_storm_desc:0 "The Desert Storm campaign of the coalition forces in the 1990s all but destroyed our military. The terrific airpower of the west sunk our navy, neutralised our air defenses, and caused our air force to flee. This mistake must not be repeated again, and our army must be trained to counter such ‘shock-and-awe’ tactics."

Why change what has been proven successful?"
 IRQ_expand_domestic_industry:0 "Expand Domestic Industry"
 IRQ_expand_domestic_industry_desc:0 "Relying on foreign powers leaves us at their mercy, and greatly restricts the independence of our foreign policy.
