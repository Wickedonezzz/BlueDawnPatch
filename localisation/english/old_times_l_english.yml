 old_times_news.1.d:0 "The latest news coming out of the Soviet Union have shocked the world as Gennady Yanayev, a man who was the main instigator of the August Coup that preserved the Soviet Union, has resigned today from the position of General Secretary.\n\nWith numerous speculations, rumors, theories and very little information directly from the Kremlin about the the development, not much is known about the reasons for this extraordinary move. Multiple political experts assumed this was either due to Yanayev's incapability to fix the Union's economic issues or pressure from within the CPSU itself.\n\nWhatever the case may be, this is a truly unexpected event that might have just changed the future of the Soviet Union. As of right now, Valentin Pavlov has been chosen by the CPSU to be the temporary General Secretary."

His outlook has raised concerns within the conservative parts of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, it sparked a sense of hope for the Soviet youth.\n\nSo far, the new General Secretary seems to have a hard job, bringing the aged nation into the new century. Many expect his efforts to fail miserably, while others think they will guide the Soviet Union to a new golden age.

 old_times_news.172.d:0 "The Kurdish People, for more than 10 years, have been killed, tortured and repressed by Saddam Hussein's Government, also using unconventional weapons such as gas, and today, they have had enough and have decided to rebel against their Oppressors.\n\nThe conflict began with Kurdish insurgents who began firing on an Iraqi militia patrol, which was located near Irbil, in full Kurdish territory. This new war in the Middle East has stirred many minds, and raised tensions with Iraq, due to the areas in which this conflict is being fought, that is, near the Iranian and Turkish borders.\n\nCurrently, the Iraqi government is doing its best to mobilize its units, and subdue the Kurdish People, while other countries bordering the war zone are taking action, in defending themselves in the event of attacks by the Insurgents, or "Diplomatic Incidents" with Iraqi troops."
