 ussr_intro.1.d:0 "“It had been less than 10 years from that fateful day, August 19th, 1991. The moment those tanks rolled into Moscow, nobody knew that we would be changing history; nobody understood the gravity of the situation at hand, of the unfolding events that would change the very course of Russia's path. The day that it all went down, and the week that followed, would come to define us; define our glorious Union; define our situation for the foreseeable future. It was the August Coup. Our forces had moved with great haste and swift prejudice--we couldn’t watch as our glorious Motherland died, we simply couldn’t stand by and watch as it all came apart, and so we did as any reasonable men in our situation would do: we took charge of the problem at hand, and we struck it down.”\n\nYanayev was correct in many ways of his assumption of how it had all played out, how the August Coup had been a kind of saving-grace, last hurrah of sorts from the Old Guard of the Communist Party, how it had, at least for now, preserved the status quo of the Soviet Union. While there was no Stalinist revival, the Yanayev regime certainly wasn’t the most amiable with Gorbachev’s open arms towards the insidious influences of the Capitalist, Imperialist West. Yanayev and the Old Guard couldn’t sit idly by and watch as the man of little reservations walked all over the spitting image of Lenin’s great experiment, the project to redeem the proletariat! And so the Coup went through, and for the first time in Russian history, it seemed that, for once, military actions hadn’t progressed or regressed the nation--everything stood still, as if time itself had frozen around the nation. The reforms came to a halt, certainly, but Yanayev knew a moderate hand was necessary to guide the course of the storm and prevent the total breakdown of the country, and seemingly it had worked out... Of course, that was what he had originally thought.\n\nWhen we had committed to the movement, when we had put our support behind the Coup, we knew there would be consequences, some as dire as member states leaving, an economic shock, a political upheaval--but then and now did we know we could deal with it all, one by one, step by step if need be. And yet here we stood, a nation hobbling its way along with one foot in an open grave, a red not so vibrant as the triumphant revolutionary it had once been. Where was Marx's sunrise? Our Glorious Red Star?"

 ussr_intro.2.t:0 "Our Biggest “Failures”"
 ussr_intro.2.d:0 "How could the Monolith that was our glorious, Communist society fail, the greatest, freest, most fair system in the world? Well, as it turns out, throwing a Government Bureaucracy through a Military Coup that replaces the entire strata of said Bureaucracy with new faces primarily based on yes-men and political affluents, there’s a good bit of slowing to be had. When Gorbachev first took office, and when he started implementing his reforms, Yanayev claims to have seen it for what it was--Capitalism with another name, a mock attempt at the abomination created in Beijing by the Dengist regime. And though they were working at least for the time, Yanayev knew that to preserve the Socialist Model he’d have to act quickly to bring it all to a halt. Well, to do that, he had to do a small bit of economic remodeling; some tariffs here, business blocking there, and of course go through with almost returning to a military budget proportional to the Second World War.\n\nYanayev, a Military Man himself, with backing from the Military Industrial Complex, had many faces to appease in the wake of the coup, and to do that would cost him, and more importantly the Moscow treasuries, a large sum to both bolster and rebuff our friends in the Armed Forces; men who demanded larger salaries, men who demanded that we return to an “on-guard” position in the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, men who even began demanding that we kickstart a new phase of the Cold War to try and harness the economy. While the Military Industrial Complex does have its charms, and for several years provided many numerous jobs, we eventually ran out of production necessities: we had all the ammunition, tanks, aircraft we could ever need, even with NATO’s imperialist fingers crawling their way into Eastern Europe, and soon enough, the jobs started to fall through, while the spending kept going: Yanayev knew that once he lost the support of his allies in the military, it was all over, as there would be yet another internal power struggle, now with everyone being armed to the teeth.\n\nThe sudden influx of unemployment into the market was of course offset by the brilliant genius of our Economic Mastery, the Controlled Economy allowing us to assign jobs and duties, but by some work of the West, it hasn’t done much to improve things. We haven’t fallen, per say, but we haven’t progressed either; the economy is in a clear bout of stagnation, a several-year long period of a failure to advance the wellbeing of a population growingly unsettled with the reverting of all of Gorbachev’s work. Now we’re looking down the barrel of both the economy and the military..."

 ussr_intro.3.t:0 "The Elephant(s) in the Room"
 ussr_intro.3.d:0 "With a growingly discontented population, a stagnating economy, fragile political balance, and a worriedly skewed global order, the last thing the Union needed right now was a massive, internalized political struggle over the Chairman’s favor and position.\n\nAnd thus that’s exactly what we’ve been facing since 1991. When you overthrow a popular government via military means, overturn the entire economic direction of the nation, and start meddling with names like “Glasnost” and “Perestroika,” you’re bound to ruffle some feathers, feathers that are attached to vultures and predators alike, men who will gladly tear us apart from the inside to gain power and see out their own sick, twisted vision of our glorious Union.\n\nMen from the military, for instance, hold some of the scariest influence of the lot simply because they hold sway both over the Armed Forces, and more worryingly, over Yanayev himself. The “Militarist Faction,” led by one Marshal Dmitry Yazov, the Militarists’ powers derive from their economic grapple over the Military Industrial Complex, and because they control the very entity that helped Gennady Yanayev take control in the first place--what Yazov says comes with a friendly attached letter that will gladly and openly put into fresh words “or else,” which though not literal haunts the General Secretary day by day. A traditionalist of the Soviet system, Yazov and his gang are not to be underestimated... Not all “Good Soldiers” follow orders.\n\nEven the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet wasn’t safe, with men like Boris Pugo, Secretary of the Interior, working at his own goals to see the USSR rebuilt in an image that was almost mirrored by his former compatriot and the late Secretary, Yuri Andropov; a plan to return to the strongly command economic system, a crackdown on internal dissent and corruption, a strong yet anti-war approach to America and the NATO snakes. While the military holds sway due to its might, Pugo and his cronies exercise their strength by how close they sit to Yanayev. Some keep friends close and enemies closer; when the lines are blurred on who’s who, that becomes a much more risky game of cat and mouse.\n\nLet’s not forget to add on to the pile our good friend, the former Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, who’s still out there--still writing books, still playing hardball even when he’s no longer in Moscow politics. And somehow, he commands respect from the people, OUR people! How does this has-been that we threw out of office nearly ten years ago still somehow bring these people to rise? Well, that may come down to policy, but Yanayev will never admit that giving people greater political and economic autonomy is the driving force there... Gorbachev is still a danger, though, and should never be seen as a nobody. He poses a threat almost as great as the “upstart.”\n\nThat upstart just so happens to originate from the KGB, a young and spry man, head of the organization for that matter. He would happen to be Vladimir-"

 ussr_intro.4.t:0 "An Old Man, an Older Nation"
 ussr_intro.4.d:0 "Yanayev could not sit on his laurels forever; the Union is facing some of the worst issues it has faced since the Spring of ‘56, and things don’t seem to be improving. With the economy in shambles, the political landscape of the nation on the brink of tossing Russia into yet another mad dash for power, and with the world staring at Moscow waiting for a response, the aging Chairman is starting to feel the weight of not only Russia, but the entire globe, barreling down on his shoulders. He’ll be turning 63 this year, and all of the stress from the coup, from the failing policy, from his inability to act given he had to play nice with so many internal factions, the public outcry, the mounting diplomatic forces, was perhaps too much for his frail shoulders to bear anymore.\n\nHow much longer could little Gennady keep at the game? How much longer could he try in desperation to carry on the mantle of Marx, of Comrade Lenin? Frankly, even he didn’t know the answer to that question. He was an old man with enemies on all sides, enemies masquerading as friends, and friends acting like enemies. He was stuck, he was suffering, and with him so too was the Soviet Union stuck and suffering. There would be no quiet recovery, there couldn’t be any way to fix these issues by sitting back and praying for the best--Russia didn’t just need a hero, it needed a Savior, and for the first time in his life, Yanayev was starting to doubt his abilities to carry that title. Could he, could anyone, really save Russia at this point?\n\nWith the factions mounting up for the coming Party Meetings, and with the entire nation sitting on the edges of their seats, waiting in anticipation for an answer from the Kremlin, it would all come down to this. The Chairman’s position was crumbling around him, Russia, though only stagnating now, showed no signs that recovery was on the horizon. We’ve tried our best to keep it all together, but it’s coming to a point where even we don’t know what the future holds for our beloved Union. Another coup? An economic Depression? Or God forbid, a total collapse?\n\nThe Cold War has not simply been a battle of nations, a battle of values, or even a battle of ideologies; it’s been a struggle for the very fate of the Earth, time and time again, where men, for reasons even they do not at times comprehend, will put everything on the line over one, big, red button, a button that could bring about the end of times, the end of mankind itself. These were the horrifying realities we were facing, and for once, we couldn’t hide it under propaganda, under dissidence suppression.\n\nWhere was our Red Star?"

We’ve already lost some member states to secessions in the wake of the coup, we’ve already lost our economy to the flow of stagnation, and seemingly we’ve already lost the will of our people. How can we hope to win? How can we survive?\n\nWe’ll have to figure it out one way or another. We cannot give in, we cannot surrender, we cannot accept defeat laying down! We bear the mantle of Lenin, of all the workers of the world; we beat the Nazis, we beat the Capitalists to the Stars; we beat their God, we beat their will, we’ve beat their way of life, and now all we need is the home push to prove it! Assuredly, it isn’t all propaganda, it isn’t all hopeful dreamings and rantings... Right?\n\nThe United States too has faced her own peril in recent years, surely that’s a sign! The Europeans and their filthy Union have failed to gain major traction in the Eastern Bloc, that’s definitely a sign they wish to return to their friends in Red Square! NATO hasn’t invaded yet, that too is a great success, and we still hold our seats on the United Nations security council, so obviously we’re still a capable and strong nation! Right?... Right?"

 ussr.1.d:0 "It has been a cold morning in Moscow, the New Year celebrations have passed, the entire Union entered the 21st century. However it didn't really feel like anything special, the old problems still remained, Union's policies didn't change and neither did the global political situation. But to some people like Mikhail, a worker in one of Moscow's many factories, political situation mattered very little. He would get up in the morning, have breakfast with his wife and kids and take a walk to his workplace.\n\nAs he walked down Moscow streets, he could see people walk by him, children, elderly, police officers, workers and many more. Truth be told, everyone felt the exhaustion of the economic stagnation, Gorbachev's and Yanayev's failed reforms and more than 50 years of the Cold War with the west. As he looked he could see that not everyone was happy but were grateful that at the very least, the dreaded Gorbachev era breadlines were gone. Still, no one was very pleased with the current situation either.\n\n"Mikhail, it's so good to see you." -  A voice spoke out from behind.\n\n"Ah Seryozha, it's good to see you too. But what are you doing here? Don't you take a bus every morning to work?" - Mikhail asked his friend and co-worker Seryozha.\n\n"Had to go to store to buy bread and some other stuff. I was looking for some detergent for 15 whole minutes, only to be told that there are none in stock." - Seryozha answered.\n\n"Really, it is that bad?" - Mikhail asked his friend.\n\n"Yeah. Not a lot of choices yet so little in stock. I am guessing they either have problems with supply system or perhaps they stopped making those detergents. Either way, I found another one so it wasn't a big issue. If this continues we might as well go back to the breadlines." - Seryozha said."

After extensive investigations in the 1990s, the enemies of the state have been found and removed, except Mikhail Gorbachev, as he is considered to no longer be a threat to the stability of the Union. Further, the new head of the army is Dimitry Yazov, a feared and capable man that will lead the reformed Soviet Army. The new head of the KGB is a promising young man named Vladimir Putin, and he will be instrumental to the Soviet Union. Boris Pugo will be the permanent minister of Internal Affairs, as he played a big part in the August Coup so he will remain at his position."

Blockades, sanctions, and economic wars have been imposed on us by the West for over 50 years now. All of them with one goal: to cripple us. Sad to say that it appears that they are working. The Union's only future is to either reform or vanish. Our over-militarized economy is of no help either. As much as we can show our teeth to the West, if we cannot take care of our people first, it will lead to a disaster. We will have to do some reforming or the Union of the People will not last."

 ussr.4.d:0 "Marshal Yazov issued a protest against Yanayev's decision of defunding the army. In his letter he stated that: “A country without a strong military cannot defend the workers’ revolution!”. As much as he is right, we cannot focus on only the military while our people worry about their future. This has triggered a party meeting about all the recent actions and the current state of the Soviet Union."

 ussr.5.d:0 "“Well, this is a new situation I must say. Ever since Gorbachev, no other General Secretary has ever resigned in front of the whole Union.” - Said Grishin, a rather normal Soviet Party official had it not been for the fact that he was Yanayev's secretary and right hand man.\n\n“Indeed Grishin. However, the leading Party officials, the Army leadership, the KGB and all other important people in the CPSU have been given my personal resignation latter. Now the only ones that need to be informed are the citizens.”  - Said Yanayev, rather calmly than what Grishin would expect from a man who is 'willingly' resigning from the one of the most powerful positions in the world.\n\n“It seems so. I mean, at least you can walk out after this with your head up knowing that you did the best there could have been done for the Union. But I still have a bad feeling about this. If the Party has been divided before, it sure will break apart now. Not to mention the economy.” - The man responded, talking to Yanayev not as to his superior but rather as a friend.\n\n"Don't break your head over it too much. I have given instructions to the Party leadership, the KGB and Yazov. As much as all of them crave power, at least they all wish Union to remain united so that should hold them off until it is all resolved.” - Yanayev answered.\n\n“I guess. Whatever happens, just know that in my, still early career you have been the one most memorable General Secretary, comrade Yanayev.” - Grishin  stated with a slight salute to the soon to be old General Secretary.\n\nBefore Yanayev could thank Grishin a man from the TV station walked over to inform the General Secretary to take a seat and wait for the signal to start his resignation speech.\n\nSoon enough the men have counted down the time and Yanayev begun talking. And in 7 minutes and 40 seconds, one turbulent and troubled era of the USSR ended. To many it was a slight relief but to some, it was a sign that the dark clouds were about to unleash a new and harsh future onto the Union."

Putin; who is also the current Chairman of the KGB; and another less relevant one, simply being Putin's adjutant came in. The Colonel  soon made his way in-front of Yazov, and gave him a salute, before, rather coldly saying; \n\n"It is done." \n\nNow, just saying "It is done" would not mean much to many, but knowing his own orders lately, it was rather clear what had happened. Gorbachev was dead. Now, if all went to plan, it would be a murder by some unknown hard-conservative, if not, well, there would not be enough evidence to say whatever either way. Yazov stood up, giving Putin the salute, and simply, gesturing to the door. Sitting back down, Yazov continued working on the documents, but relieved. The enemies, of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet way of life, were meeting their end. And one way, or the other, all would share the fate of Gorbachev. Through the bullet, through the pill, or by water below a bridge."

It seems that even though population in countries like Armenia and Azerbaijan have expressed their wish to join the Union, their governments have refused." - Answered Boris Pankin, the minister of foreign affairs of USSR.\n\n"Well, politically speaking it is a shame, but in the military terms I believe that the leadership will be more than happy. After all, it would be a shame for all the preparations to go to waste. Plus we will get a chance to test the state of our military capabilities." - The marshal answered.\n\n"I believe that even if that is the case, the General Secretary still needs to appro-" - Before Boris was able to even finish the sentence, a phone rang in his office.\n\nAs he picked up the phone and begun talking, marshal Kulikov was only able to hear one side of the conversation. Despite that, it was clear that either the Politburo or the General Secretary were on the other side. Whatever he was thinking in that moment evaporated once Pankin put down the phone.\n\n"It was the Politburo. They have a new order for you." - Said Pankin rather calmly.\n\n"And is that order perhaps related to the topic at hand?" - Asked Kulikov, already knowing the answer to his own question.\n\n"Yes....""

We did everything, how can it possibly not be working." -  Yanayev looked at economic reports that the Union's economic ministry delivered to him.\n\nAfter putting the papers on his desk, he sat back in his chair. Looking at the clock, only then did he realize it was well past midnight. Almost 20 hours without sleep, for what? Another failure. He just sighed and taught to himself. How old were all the other General Secretaries before him, perhaps it was time for him to finally consider retirement. After all, Party could decide who could replace him, maybe Krychkov could come out of retirement and take temporary leadership until the Party sorts itself out. Still he couldn't really leave it empty, besides main players like Pugo and Yazov, there were many more, ready to tear each other apart as soon as he either resigned or kicked the bucket. But whatever he was thinking in that moment was quickly dashed aside as soon as one of the officers entered.\n\n"Comrade Yanayev. I am delivering a letter from comrade Gennady Zyuganov. He requested that this letter be urgently sent to you." - Officer said.\n\nYanayev took the letter into his hands and then dismissed the officer. Opening it, he didn't know what to expect but there was a feeling that it couldn't be anything good. Letter was rather simple, written by hand even, instead on a machine or computer. Besides normal greetings there was a rather troublesome part.\n\n"Besides regular bickering in the Party, many of my close friends and comrades have brought me troubling information that some elements of the Party are considering your removal due to, as they state 'failures of reforms and overall leadership'.

It was almost as if he was preparing his whole life for this, but nothing could prepare anyone for the responsibility of fixing the mess that was the USSR.\n\n"Truth be told, are you sure that you are ready for this? No bad intentions but you are a bit old for leading the USSR." - The man told Pugo in a way like he wanted to tell him the obvious.\n\n"Don't worry about my age Vladimir. I might not be as young as I was but I am more than ready to lead this nation out of this mess. After all I was among those who saved it ten years ago, and I am not ready to give up on this nation now." - Pugo answered the man with a serious look on his face.

Truth be told, his position was nothing more but to be a guard at the main entrance and to salute to the arriving Party officials.\n\nAnd so he took his position in a small post standing right besides main entrance. Overlooking him on the other side was his superior Anatoly who corrected, taught and got the new recruit ready for the future service. And just as Sergey was thinking that the day couldn't get more boring a small column pulled up to the gates. Three black cars with two police motors in front and two in the back in the back. Just who was such an important person that needs this much protection, was the first thought that came to Sergey's mind.\n\nAnd just then as he walked up to the mirror of the first car to check, his eyes widened in surprise, it was the newly elected General Secretary Boris Pugo.\n\nSergey was at a loss of words, first day of work and he already gets to see the most powerful man in the entire Union. But as soon as he realised that Pugo and the KGB officials who were with him in the car started to look at him, he quickly gave a salute to the men. For his gesture he got a smile from Pugo and a small chuckle from one of the officials as the column entered the Kremlin.\n\n"What is it comrade Sergey. You look like you've seen a ghost.

One that is uncommon and far more brutal than any battlefield Yazov was on. Nevertheless, he was chosen for the General Secretary's position which means that everyone counts on him to fix the mess the Party has become in the recent decades.\n\nIt wasn't uncommon that the generals and marshals of the Soviet Army could find themselves in the middle of political conflict, many before even actively participated in it. However, for Yazov who only knew how to gather the loyal generals and politicians around him it was an entirely new world, one that doesn't forgive mistakes so easily. That is why he needed something, some miracle or perhaps, friends. Despite many differences, the hardline wing of the Party would probably be willing to cooperate with Yazov as long as he retains the Brezhnev era internal politics and KGB would be happy as long as they could hold their power.\n\nDespite the very good benefits, this would mean that Yazov's power will not be certain, revisionists and opportunists in other factions would remain with only difference being their boss. Maybe it was better if he walked this path alone? Maybe he could save the Soviet Union by himself or maybe he would need some allies in the mess that the CPSU has become."

No one could really put it together that two factions in the CPSU could even think of cooperating, yet for Pugo it wasn't all that unusual. After all, both the militarists and the conservatives shared mostly the same policies with only difference being the foreign policy. However this didn't make all of his scepticism invalid, Yazov may be more of a military figure rather than a politican but even he had some tricks up his sleeve.\n\nMaybe this was a way for Yazov to get rid of conservative wing's power and just keep them as a puppet or maybe it could be a final solution to the reformist problem that still plagues the Party. However, his line of thinking was broken by the realisation that Zyuganov was waiting for an answer:\n\n"Yes Zyuganov, it is a bit strange but still we need to consider this as an opportunity. Yazov has been elected as the General Secretary, but even his little clique needs administration and who shall be the ones to fill that spot?"\n\n"I suppose us, comrade Boris Karlovich."  - Zyuganov answered, seeming catching onto Pugo's proposal.\n\nPugo continued: "That is why we should align with Yazov. This is a great opportunity to rid the Party of factionalism while still retaining influential position."\n\n"I see. Than I can presume this matter has been dealt with." - Zyuganov stated as he got up from his chair."

Together with the recent expulsion of more moderate and liberal elements of the Party, these policies have finally turned this uneasiness of the younger generations into rage that has been shown in the streets of many cities in the Union. The most fierce example have been the Minsk riots that have been taking place for over two weeks already in the city.\n\nMore foolish than brave, the rioters fought with the police demanding more changes in the government and release of the imprisoned Party members. These violent actions have, instead of changes, brought an even more fierce reaction.\n\nThree mechanized battalions of the city garrison have been brought into the middle of the city itself late last night. All foreign and domestic media has been moved to the press conference of the city mayor at 07:30. At 07:45 the troops moved in, closing the circle around the protestors.

At least not for now." - Romanov answered.\n\nYazov just sat back in his seat, looking trough the windows of the car and into the plains surrounding Moscow. There was something that he couldn't understand about all of these politics. He knew that liberals wouldn't want to cooperate with him and neither he wanted with them but Pugo and the conservatives were different. Sure, their external policies were different but internally they practically had no difference. Only thing that broke his line of thought was Romanov's voice.\n\n"I believe that this is quite unfortunate but still we must move one. I know that you are not all that specialized with inner Party politics so you can leave that to me. As for more, let's just say dirty work I can leave it to you. After all you have dealt with it in 91' so you might have experience with using military force to protect our stability."\n\nYazov quickly regained himself: "Yes. Well I can just thank you for trying Romanov but still, Party politics are important to me too so I will see what I can do. But then again, even with all the help I just feel like a one man on a task to fix a half a century old problem in this country.""

Whatever he thought in that moment quickly disappeared as soon as he stepped to the microphone, he had to do it now.\n\nThe speech was not long or short, it was just enough.

From tonight onwards, the governments of new republics will take power over administrative functions in former SSRs.

It is clear he would lead this Union down a hardline path, much to the dismay and panic of the revisionists within the party as Zyuganov preaches a ‘reforging of Soviet ideals’ as he calls it, no doubt his reign would re-shape the world's perception on the very fiber of modern Marxism and Leninism within our Union.\n\nThe second less known candidate for leadership is a certain economist by the name of Oleg Baklanov, who is far more moderate as compared to Zyuganov when it comes to a variety of factors, specifically his views on the Soviet economy. Baklanov has prided himself as being a well-known figure within Soviet industry and was key in modernizing a majority of the systems within the USSR such as machinery and communications. This reputation would be far more positively received amongst the more moderate factions within our Party, however, his legacy of being a member of the GKChP in 1991 might not win us over the trust of the reformist wing of the Party."

From Leningrad, to Kiev, to Omsk, and Vladivostok, rioters smash windows, burn portraits of Lenin and Marx, and loot any government building they can get too.\n\nThe situation is even more dire in the very heart of the Union, as Moscow itself is strangled by street violence and conflict between liberals, nationalists, pro-Soviet protesters and the Soviet authorities. The hordes of students, teachers, and even workers outright revolt against the leadership, in protests not seen since 1991. In a majority of cases, particularly violent and dedicated rebels set up barricades and hastily made forts, stocking looted goods and weapons, preparing for the harsh retaliation from other factions or the Soviet Army, who themselves are facing draft dodgers and servicemen begin to question and disobey orders from their officers.\n\nLocal governments and autonomies are in a state of panic as the anarchic-like hordes of protesters overwhelm local police units and in some cases seize higher level government officials, beating them in their offices and holding them hostage. Chants of freedom, liberalization, nationalism and anti-Soviet opinions are echoed throughout every single major population center within our Union.\n\nWe must respond, we must act, we must contain the situation, we must do something!

A job which was all too simple, Ivan should have known that there was going to be a catch to it.\n\nAt first everything went smoothly, commands were simple, and their desired receivers were easy to locate, that was until the troubles in the Union began. Now the orders became more and more dire, with reports turning from concerns over native unrest and requests for ammunition, to urgent requests for manpower to handle riots and calls for reinforcements due to insurgents. While he still directed the orders as usual, he felt more and more nervous with every panicked call he received, which only grew in numbers. His leading stationed officer Bansko was even worse. While at first he was the same tired old Bansko who smoked a pack a day, now he was sweating buckets as he received more and more calls from HQ, sending him pacing around his office, which firmly kept Ivans head down facing his work, as well as his coworkers.\n\nOne day, after Ivan again redirected another urgent call for guns coming from a garrison in Crimea, he received an abnormal call from the garrison near Minsk.\n\n“This is Moscow telecommunications who would you like to-”, Ivan was cut off with a shout by the caller.\n\n“Tell the shiteaters in Moscow to go fuck themselves, go to hell and glory to Lukashenko and the Soviet Union!”, and with that the call dropped.\n\n“Wait...what? The hell was that? Was that a prank caller?”, Ivan thought to himself, before checking to see where the call originated from. It was from the 45th Belarusian guard regiment, one of the largest garrison divisions present in the Belarus ASSR. Ivan then attempted to call the regiment, maybe it was a drunk private who got his hands on the radio. ‘UNAVAILABLE’ it read back to him on the computer. “That's impossible, that only happens if they disconnected the rece-”, Ivan paused, dread began to build in him as he began to realize just how bad the situation was in Minsk, as well as what he would have to do next.\n\nIvan got up and began to walk toward Bansko’s office, knocking on the door and placing a note in his officer's mailbox.\n\nIvan hastily returned to his seat as he saw Bansko take the note, read through it, and went to get another vodka from the back."

The Reformists ideals of communism were at least somewhat familiar to the wider public, with a few exceptions when it came to the economic and social aspects, but Eurasianism was completely unfamiliar any nation, with the only states upholding the traits of this ideology having collapsed centuries ago. This modern form of Eurasianism advocated mainly nationalistic sentiments, as well as an authoritarian ideology that would likely tear down much of the socialist foundations which have existed for decades now. The final vote would decide much of this, and on the outside this looked like a soon-to-be deciding victory for the Reformists, but with the Eurasianist having this much of an enlargement in past times, maybe this will not be the case.\n\nThe debates began with a speech from a Eurasianist delegate, Alexander Dugin, propagating for one final time the glory of Eurasianism, its strengths, its fortunes, as well as attacking the Reformists in the chamber, or the “Mongrels” as they called them, of course the speech was received with boos and jeers from the left side of the congress.\n\nAfter many more arguments, controversial speeches, disagreements, and even a shoe thrown once or twice from both sides, eventually the vote came down, and its results would be a victory for the…"

But, Yanayev didn't come for treats or drinks, but to talk about the ongoing politics of the USSR, for this seemingly bloated and elderly man was Vladimir Krychkov, former head of the KGB.\n\nTheir talks began innocently enough, catching up and discussing one another's current and former careers. But then gradually talks began to shift, from the innocent chatter of friends, to more serious talks of governing and rule. As expected it quickly turned sour…\n\n“Say what you want Yanayev, but our nation is in turmoil. We may have stopped it from crumbling, but this does not make it stable. If you continue your reforms, I warn you that you will make yourself an enemy to every man who worked to see our nation continue to the next century. Reform is what got Gorbachev ousted, and it's what will get you killed. Leave whilst you still can. I did, and so should you.”\n\nThe words hit deep. Yanayev knew that he spoke the truth. Soon he would either be found dead, going down in history as another weak politician who was too ill fit for his position. Or he would stop his reforms, and give up his position as General Secretary, perhaps retiring, and saving what reputation he has left.

One such conspirator is Minister of Defence, Dmitry Yazov, who has been critical of Yanayev's liberal policies ever since the coup. He and his fellow co-conspirators have taken it upon themselves to organise a meeting for only the highest members of the military.\n\nThis meeting took place in a barrack on the far outskirts of Leningrad, far from the eyes of the spineless bureaucrats or Yanayev. Here, Yazov made his concerns clear to the high command: if they did not step in, the Union they had fought so hard to protect would crumble like a house of cards. Only the Army, the backbone of the Soviet proletariat, could insure the continuous prosperity of the USSR, and finally, reassert its place as a superpower on the World stage.

This means that from today on you are no longer part of the Mongolian People's Army, hence why I warmly welcome you to the Soviet Armed Forces."\n\nThe soldiers' expressions remained the same, perhaps they either didn't really care about the current events or were just too confused to ask any questions.\n\n"If there are any doubts or questions, I am here to answer them, but to clear out the elefant in the room, no, your paychecks and your ranks won't be changed.

These previous feelings of superiority and confidence were soon shattered in an outstanding display of his future opponent’s might.\n\nTo the left of the congress were Pugo, Yazov and their respective clique of old bureaucrats and Army generals, who might as well have been aiming rifles at his head as he walked to the podium, the ones who had despised his very being, he could almost hear their words of death wished upon him from under their breaths.

Though maybe they weren't all bad, certainly not as dreadful as Pugo’s goons or Yazov's little soldiers, they might provide some leverage in future acts, Putin thought.\n\nFinally, right behind Putin was the center faction, the model moderates, his loyalists, the ones who were so loyal to him they might as well have acted as yes-men, a trait Putin had no problem with whatsoever. There was Rustkoy on the stands, waving proudly to the cameras as Putin walked in, causing Putin to reflect on the fanfare this entire thing was, good publicity; yes, enjoyable; no.\n\nAt last Putin arrived to stand at the podium, overseeing the many delegates, some applauded, some glared, most sat ready to hear whatever Vladimir had to say, whether they would clap or not was to be decided."

We await your decision”, the delegate finished his side of the negotiations with the opening of binder and the click of a pen, waiting for Romans side.\n\nRoman pondered on this, his mission was to do whatever it took to benefit the Union and make sure that his side didn't get the loser's end of the deal, and if he failed, his 23 year career would mean nothing in the face of a prison in Zlatoust. He turned to his fellow delegates for debates, with his fellow soviet delegates and aides thinking this deal wasn't such a bad idea as first thought, and the Bulgarians exasperating that this would bring a downfall to Soviet strength in the region. While gaining Yugoslavia as an ally would solidify the presence of a united socialist front in the Balkans, they wouldn't be as submissive as the satellite states which had lied under Soviet boots for decades.\n\nIn the end, Roman would ask the real deciders in these debates, picking up the phone and dialing the Moscow hotline, after a brief chat with the premier himself, with Roman explaining the offers and demands, he would finally get a response.

Whatever he said now would become foundational, even if it was just a few brief remarks, it would send a message, or at least he thought it would.\n\n1:28 PM\n\nJust a few more seconds, already the assisting staff had left the room, aside from a few record takers, there was a sense of timid anticipation, there hadn't been a new voice to address the Union since the coup. Ryzhkov steadied his hair, drank down a few mouthfuls of water, cleared his throat, and braced for this beacon of a moment. The cameraman held out his hand, counting down the seconds, with Ryzhkov nodding at the final five seconds, turning to four, three, two, one..\n\n1:30 PM, Showtime\n\n"Fellow citizens of the Soviet Union, I address you in a moment where our Union is in a precarious position, with an ailing economy and the loss of multiple Socialist Republics, our past leaders have failed us time and time again. We mustn't give up hope however, the vision of Lenin is yet to be complete, and true glory lies just in reach. I believe, my friends, that with the united cooperation of the many peoples of our Soviet republics, our Union shall enter a golden age to surpass all our rivals and those who wish us harm, for our Socialist Union shall soon be the pinnacle of all Eurasia…""

Outside of the car were a series of news reporters, and within them was Ryzhkov himself, along with multiple fellow reformists of the politburo. As the door halted and the chauffeur went to open the door, the cameras unleashed a cacophony of flashes, with guards having to keep back the hyped up journalists. Ryzhkov stood his ground at the front of them all as Gorbachev exited the car, he had prepared his whole life to meet the man who the entire Union had turned against all those years ago, and to be frank, he was quite surprised at the man he saw.\n\nGorbachev was nowhere near the confident, and emboldened soviet official he had seen back in the 80’s, that spark of progress in his eyes and his tone of speech were long gone now. He was hunched, walking almost to appear like he was limping, his eyes carrying tired bags, age had eaten away at him, further made obvious by the heavy coat he wore along with a black cap. Ryzhkov was almost bewildered, had they gotten the right man? As Gorbachev walked over to him, he almost felt sorry for the man, Gorbachev took off his cap, exposing his signature birthmark on his cranium, "Nikolai, I cannot thank you enough”. Ryzhkov cleared his throat as nonchalantly as possible, "Please, let us discuss this inside".\n\nGorbachev drank from the warm tea as Ryzhkov’s aids kept the room nice and tidy, "I arranged everything you will need in your new home, 4 rooms, assistants, even a new Lada.", Ryzhkov wanted Gorbachev to feel at ease, a man like him would understandably be quite paranoid after his government has couped him not too many years ago. Gorbachev took a break from his sipping, "I greatly appreciate your accommodations Nikolai, these times have not been... easy, to say the least.", the room fell silent, even the door guards could sense the unease along with the hatred accumulating in Gorbachev's voice. Ryzhkov shifted the subject, "Well, the times have changed now, and I am will ensure it. I know that even after all your own... failures, the this Union has wronged you deeply, and for that I am sorry, but together we can secure the prosperity of our many socialist republics for the next century."\n\nA smile touched Gorbachev's lips as he looked up at Ryzhkov, "You are quite right comrade.""

As the clock ticked idly by he grew further frustrated at just how badly he needed this kleptocrat’s help, the man who he didn't outright hate, but the idea of working with the man was begrudging at best; Putin. What made it worse was that the bastard was smart, hell he probably knew that he needed his help too. Fine, might as well get it over with now.\n\nRyzhkov picked up the phone and dialed in the number, his mind switched between regarding this as a very good or a very bad idea as it rang, until the line picked up.\n\n"Comrade Ryzhkov, congratulations on your promotion, how could I help you today?".\n\nRyzhkov hid his immediate retort and put on a more diplomatic tone of voice, "Comrade Putin, I would like to ask you for… a favor. The Hardliners in the party will stop at nothing to forbid my reforms, my reformers faction, although strong, is not powerful enough to effectively deal with Pugo’s followers alone, I need your assistance".\n\nRyzhkov braced for the sly dogs comeback, only to be rather underwhelmed at what Putin said next, "...and how do you suppose we deal with them? You might be the General Secretary, but Pugo and Yazov hold much more influence that even I cannot match, it will be difficult I’ll say that".\n\nRyzhkov was almost shocked, for once Putin didn't sound so confident, maybe they had something in common after all, "Well, I have a few ideas, but I can only indulge you if you and your faction agrees to help, we cannot do that without each other, because mark my words, there will be severe consequences otherwise…understood?".\n\nRyzhkov had a feeling of pride swell up in his chest, time for him to be demanding, he could hear the hesitancy in Putin's voice as he responded, "Yes, I understand, you have our support, Nikolai."\n\nRyzhkov reclined back in his seat, the frustration and nervousness in his mind cleared away, "Good, I hope to begin our operations as soon as possible, have a good day comrade Putin".\n\nAs he put the phone back on the receiver, Ryzhkov pressed the button to call his secretary, "Maria, add something to my schedule, we will be having a special guest soon, thank you.""

Thanks to Ryzhkov’s economic reforms, the Union has overseen explosive economic growth over the past few years, with the opportunities of the average soviet citizen at new heights. Along with this, our premiers genius foreign diplomacy has entrenched the security of the USSR and amplified its influence abroad, in both ifs former dominions in Europe as well as new potential allies across the planet.\n\nWith this series of successes, many have coined the term, “The New Bukharin”, or "Lenin’s New Golden Boy" when referring to Ryzhkov, who’s policies have indeed mirrored many aspects of Bukharin's NEP and market socialist ideals.

Good evening, good day, and good night to all of those watching from across the Union. I understand that many of you are quite confused at the lack of presence from those within the hardliner faction, but rest assured, all is well and good. After a series of deep investigations, counter-corruption programs, and heinous discoveries, it has become clear to me that many within the Hardliner clique of the party congress are and have been long standing traitors to the Union and its people".\n\nThe announcement sent waves throughout the congress, the hardliners which were left were furious, the Putnists were appalled, even the reformists were shook at this action, nevertheless Ryzhkov continued. "We have managed to trace back significant benefactors to nationalist and separatist elements within the regional oblasts and cities to significantly influential members of the military and state, such as Yazov, Pugo, Akhromeyev, Romanov, and many others. As of today all of these criminals are currently under arrest, with their lackeys either with them in prisons are being hunted down as we speak. Gentlemen, let me make this clear. I do not intend to stop protecting this Union from the influences of reactionary and traitorous elements until the day I die. Disagree with my actions if you must, join in my pursuits if you will, either way I will not stop fighting for true justice for the Soviet Union and its people, understand?".\n\nThen, whether out of fear for their lives or respect for his decision, the congress rose and boomed with applause, it would be a new age."

He was watching a show after all.\n\nOutside, Red Army soldiers lined the streets, a band of them entering the Party Congress to escort the now uninvited party guests. After a brief moment of curiosity of who would be hailed out first Ryzhkov then smiled at the circus being presented in front of him, the joy this produced was immeasurable.\n\nThere was Romanov, he seemed to be pleading to one of the generals overseeing this swamp-draining, his pleading ended right as he was shoved into a truck. Then came Zyuganov who... was he praying? He's lucky that one of the guards didn't crack his head open for that. Look at that, Akrhomeyev was next, Ryzhkov could see the surprised and confused looks from the soldiers, witnessing their corrupt war hero finally tossed out, he was one of the more beloved ones amongst the ranks.\n\nRyzhkov took another sweet sip before the VIPrisoners came into the scene, the men of honor in shackles, Pugo and Yazov themselves. Yazov was the first to come out, his hulk-like structure of a body was being escorted by several soldiers, his face a mix of fury and disappointment, he stared down every man and woman who was in his sights before he looked up at Ryzhkov's window. Even though he knew Yazov couldn’t see him directly Ryzhkov could still feel a slight chill in his spine, that stare could spook an army.\n\nThen came Pugo, that sad little old man, he was the one with the highest power amongst them all, yet now Ryzhkov could see that he was the least imposing. He only stared down with a frown as he was brought towards his car, looking back and taking one last look at the lair he once ruled over before looking back down once again, off to a fate that Ryzhkov didn’t particularly care about, all he knew was that his worst political enemies, while not arrested yet, were as far away from the party congress as can be."

He eyed the television, airing a live screening of the party congress as every member cast their notion forward, as usual, this sparked multiple arguments and confrontations. Ryzhkov could almost chuckle at some of the speeches made against his act, a particularly notable one coming from the gentlemen from Sverdlovsk, speaking of how this would 'bring the days of plowshares and cattle back to Moscow'.\n\nNext to Ryzhkov sat his fellow ministers, both of economy and industrial production respectively, both clearly more worrisome of the debacle in front of them than Ryzhkov, who held the spirit of a man purly exhausted. Just getting this reform into the congress in the first place was a hassle, jumping through political hoops just to get the right people to configure his first economic reform, now he had to watch as the Hardliners went through a frenzy over this piece of 'capitalist filth', their words.\n\nAfter what felt like hours, the final votes were tallied and the head announcer stepped up to the stand, papers of the results in hand. Ryzhkov eyed the screen in suspicion, already he could tell something was wrong; he could see Pugo reclined in his seat, a slight smile visible on that old bastard's face. Right next to him sat Grigory Romanov, similarly smiling, the sight of the two men clearly satisfied raised red flags in Ryzhkovs mind, his fears confirmed as the announcer spoke of the results. "The results for Comrade Ryzhkov’s economic reform notion are in…the party congress has blocked the notion in… a majority vote", boasts and shouts of anger were heard from the reformists, accusations of corruption thrown at the hardliners who sat idly in their seats.\n\nRyzhkov’s department heads turned their heads, both of anger and disappointment, "This is complete bullshit! Pugo and his lackeys must've paid off some of Putin's men, or even ours!". Ryzhkov motioned for silence in the room for his hand, “Come now comrade Vaskily, we mustn't let our anger consume us”. Vaskily calmed himself, “With all due respect comrade Ryzhkov, how must you stay at such ease after such an obvious show of corruption?”. Ryzhkov reclined in his seat, "It is because, unlike all those other times those spineless dumbasses stumped our march towards progress, this time, I have a plan to properly deal with them, no more games, no more tricks"."

Unfortunately, some people in our country have unwittingly fallen into their hands.\n\nIt is undeniable that there were flawed policies during Brezhnev's era that harmed the solidarity of the Soviet people, particularly regarding the treatment of certain republics. However, instead of addressing these problems through reforms and practical measures, those who called them self "intellectual" engage in trivial and unproductive quarrels, diverting attention from the essential matters. This approach serves to conceal unintentional or intentional support for reactionary policies, such as advocating for the separation of ethnic groups from our united union of nations. They demand "autonomy" and "independence," but conveniently overlook the crucial questions that need to be asked:"What is the purpose of autonomy?" and "What does independence truly entail?" Furthermore, they fail to address the fundamental question of leadership after achieving independence.\n\nUnlike these individuals, we are not foolish. Now is the time to devise appropriate social and economic policies that will strengthen our union and foster greater unity and freedom.

We could face more resistance from the small, yet loud minority, just like in the 1989.\n\nOn the other hand, economic and political influence could take time and even just straight up hand over some ex-Warsaw Pact countries to the USA. But it could prevent resistance in the long run and even make these countries more reliant on the USSR."

 usa_intro.1.t:0 "The State of the Union"
 usa_intro.1.d:0 "With the Soviet Union hobbling its way towards the 21st Century on its last legs, the Cold War had seemed all but over; the Americans watched as the Eastern Bloc ran off in its own, separate direction; watched as the Soviet’s allies began to receive less and less support from Moscow; watched as the dreaded Bear of the East slowly began to enter a permanent hibernation. And yet, for all intents and purposes, for some reason, it didn’t–it was weakened, certainly, but not dead by any means. The Soviet Union would live on, and the American political rings from all sides began to feel the shockwave of this revelation by early 1992. \n\nNo one was quite expecting the chances of Soviet survival; no one on the Left or Right thought it possible for the “Evil Empire” to retain in the world following the Coup, and the American Socialists were just as stunned that the rapidly reformed USSR had just been spun on its head, and as had their directives as political entities. The American nation hadn’t changed much because of it, but the attitude in the air wasn’t so much of “We’ve Won” but more so of “The War’s Still On.” Were the Soviets realistically a threat? Not particularly. Were the American people still on guard? Indeed. Reagan had sown the seeds of what many hoped was an end to the Cold War, and now, it seemed that his labors were just the beginning of the continued fight to put down the Bear. The spirit of the American nation would not be able to allow itself to put down its guard; it couldn’t accept the weakness of the Bear as a reason to finally let down their ethos that the Red Menace need be crushed at all costs. Though, unfortunately for the United States as a whole, not everyone quite agreed that the fight needed to go on, and instead began to wage a new war. \n\nThat fight would begin in the greatest tipping point in American History since the Civil War; a colossal shift in domestic and foreign policy that culminated with the devastatingly small margin, both sides were so close, so edged against one another, that for generations to come, the year 1992 would become the hotspot of a new battle within Washington itself; the Left and Right had come head to head in an internal contest to test the path of America, and to decide the fate of the Cold War, and thus, the fate of the world. And thus, 1992 would become host to..."

 usa_intro.2.d:0 "When 1992 came to pass, November Elections were growingly a to-be tense battle for all sides involved; the Republicans under incumbent, 41st President George H.W. Bush had been reeling from a mixed bag of successes–now complicated by an Economic Recession that seemingly only accentuated the President’s reneging on his promises to raise no taxes while in office; the Democrats had stepped forth with Arkansas Governor William “Bill” J. Clinton, a widely popular man of the people who sought to finally put an end to the Cold War’s spending frenzy, and coexist with the dying Soviet Union in a more peaceful world; out of the blue, an up-and-coming Texas Multimillionaire too decided to throw his hat into the Presidential ring, that being Ross Perot and his to-be-declared Reform Party, standing as a strong third option against the Democrats and Republicans for internal change across the board. All three sides had their issues, all three had their strengths, but none of them could rightly predict the outcome of the elections to come–simply by the density of the concern in the air. \n\nBush’s image had certainly been tarnished, but his Cold War efforts seemed all the more necessary as of the rise of the hostile regime under Yanayev’s more traditionally Soviet-style dictatorship out of Moscow; Clinton had the popular face, but nowhere near the credibility, and many were skeptical of the plan to let the Soviets ride peacefully into the sunset just as they began to recover from the initial shock of the August Coup; Ross Perot was a newcomer who challenged both parties with widely demanded issues, but was, indeed, outside of the two party primacy and thus nowhere near guaranteed victory at even the state level. The Republicans were reeling, the Democrats struggling, and Perot’s gang desperately clinging to whatever support they could get, and it all began to culminate together into one of if not the most tense elections of the 20th Century, not just in America, but globally. \n\nThe election was for all intents and purposes up in the air, even up until the night of, and no one quite knew what was going to happen between the popular vote or even the Electoral College–there was even blurring of the lines over how the states would vote. When voting began on November 3rd, results struggled to be tallied until early in the morning on the 4th, when every television, radio, and speaker in America blared out, before crowds of millions in bated breath..."

 usa_intro.3.d:0 "Against all odds, Bush had by only beaten Clinton by 2 Electoral College votes, marking his victory of 264:262, with Ross Perot having stolen 6 by taking the states of Maine and Alaska: “The Most Contentious Election since 1860” claiming one CNN pundit in the aftermath of the elections. The Democrats as of this time had lost a good bit of their traditional support basin to Perot’s economically social platform and the Republican Party’s avidly Anti-Communist sentiments, both of which resonating in Democrat controlled Southern States, who still voted with far more Socially-Conservative issues in mind, allowing Bush with the far stronger ticket to sweep up several of Clinton’s southern Allies, despite being a Northerner, and was even able to tag a couple dozen delegates out of the Rust Belt with his efforts to continue to back war-based industries following his excursions in Iraq and Kuwait. Recounts, while triggered, failed to give Bill the victory he had desired, but it had revealed something rather appalling to the American people... \n\nBush had failed to win the Popular vote by around a million votes, and yet was able to barely by only two electoral college votes win the Presidency. This was not particularly aided when the Reform party would grab itself a foundation in New England, where Ross Perot, despite being a Southerner in Northern lands, had made a name for himself as the man with a plan; a balance between Republicans and Democrats, and an option that wasn’t too far in either direction. This outcome, overall, put America on a rather unstable path, and the following months were just as tumultuous. \n\nOn January 20th, when Bush was for a second time inaugurated as the United States President, almost half of the Crowd was not there out of support, but a massive protest numbering nearly 50,000 people strong, who would engage in a rather controversial “march” across the city that resulted in the burnings of several American flags, a Police Standoff with Protestors outside of the White House, and nearly five hundred arrests of for Civil Disobedience, Reckless Endangerment, and one for attempting to bludgeon a Police Officer. The Protests lasted all week before city Police alongside members of the National Guard could rein in order, and the seven days of Protest would become the start of a long spiral for America into what would later become known as..."

That never really came. Just when everyone thought the American nation was on the brink of massive rioting, the chaos seemingly just stopped out of nowhere. The protesters all left en-masse in droves, the Republican party had refused to openly publicize the event as an attack on the President, and even the Media had quickly attempted to move on from the events. It was as though it had never happened, and yet, the tensions still hanged in the air. \n\nThis era was in no way for the American nation particularly bountiful and prosperous, but at the same time neither was it violent and bloody; while the odd riot or two still broke out in the cities between members of both the Left and Right, the decade itself didn’t follow in the trend of the January Riots. Instead, it followed more the aftermath; no one knew entirely how to feel, and the entire nation entered into a sort of gray zone, an imbalance in the universe itself as the entirety of America sat by for the ride. The tensions around every citizen were palpable, as though one could reach out and grab it, and yet it never came–no great eruption, no horrible collapse. Time simply moved on, and no one could entirely believe it. \n\nPresident Bush would continue to fight on for the next four years of his term in office, watching the Soviet’s every move, building relations in the former Eastern Bloc nations, and even working to oversee the reconstruction of Germany following a period of unrest in the reintegrated East. Bush would use these successes as a cudgel of sorts coming into the 1996 elections, with his popular Vice President Dan Quayle taking up the Republican ballot, and the victory in the end with 282 electoral college votes and 41% of the popular vote; Clinton ran again despite only barely beating out fellow Democrat Lyndon LaRouche at the primaries, and entering into the General elections faced a major blowout with only about 27% of the Popular Vote, and 181 Electoral College votes; Ross Perot on the other hand had advanced his position to taking 32% of the popular vote, securing all of New England, and a large portion of the California voting base. \n\nWith Three parties in the Senate and Congress by the end of the decade, the government had been rather much slowed down; an inability to respond appropriately to many issues, the emergence of Tripartisan politics, and the struggle to find a solution to the Soviet issue had left America in a position of indecisiveness. The Government by 1997 was now feeling the full effect that the nation itself had felt; division that did not tear asunder; a break in the chain and yet the continued march of progress. Time stood still, and yet it still flowed onwards. It was, as the name implied, all in a state of unease..."

The Economic bubble looming on the horizon as well as the jubilance of the New Year had helped to shake off most of the unrest and indecisiveness among the public, but there were still many skeptical voices in the face of what seemed to be the next torch thrown wildly into the darkness of the unknown. \n\nWith the Soviet Union still trudging along, with the Government divided as ever, and with NATO starting to grow more and more fed up with American practices up to this point, all eyes were now turning on to the Land of the Free to get off the ground and start marching. Johnny came marching home from far worse, surely this wouldn’t be the end of the Yanks, and surely they would come out swinging, right? Surely this was the moment when the Star Spangled Banner flew bravely in the air, on land, and sea? Well... No one really knew, least so the Americans.

These were, of course, expected responses, but assuredly some of them would vote to support the bill, right? At least to claim clout for the coming election season, right?\n\nThings began to rapidly deteriorate when several Republican members of the Senate also began to voice distaste for the bill, with one Senator, Ted Stevens of Alaska, claiming that the bill was an open insult to the suffering people of America, and how it would completely overthrow the budget!

Quayle puffs back a cigarette while he reads early polster remarks: the headlines mostly read the same, some drivel about how the Democrats and Reformists are due for an easy ride into the House and Senate, how the Presidency is up in the air, how everyone knows the Republican party is about to face her greatest challenge yet...\n\nThe smoke does little to calm the President’s nerves as the newspaper rides through his eyes: “Is Quayle done for” asks one editorial, and that seemingly was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

The doctors said he’d be fine, said he’d have no issue with it as time went on, but then why in Christ’s holy name were they still burning?!\n\nThe itch wouldn’t go away, the inflammation never went down, and the red spot coursing across his thigh never seemingly gave in. It was as if he was suffering from someone constantly rubbing poison ivy on his legs, and yet he could never wash off the oils. If he had to suffer with it another moment, he’d probably have started screaming about the Oval office in a tizzy...\n\n“Mr. President?” A voice came in from his secretary’s room, familiar and yet muffled under his own thoughts. Quayle looked up at the door, and barked with an unenthusiastic groan “Come in” as a response. Through the door stepped a friend, a close one, the family doctor of course–did he have another prescription? Another drug...? No, he just had a stack of papers. And an oddly depressed look on his face. The President had been so busy over the past several years, moving around and taking so many damned tests that he hadn’t “seen” the man in so long that he almost didn’t recognize his face.\n\n“Dan, I’m sorry to say this to you, but your testing results came back... What started as a small affliction, well, because you never let it rest and clear up has become much more severe.

It was a beautiful sight in all ways, as it had been the past three times he’d done this exact thing... But this time was to be a little different.\n\nOf course, the main attraction was to be his fiery address about Americanism, and the Declaration, and what it means to hold your hand on your heart with a hotdog in your mouth at the Ballgame; all the usual flag-waving stuff, this was after all the celebration of Independence day, but he couldn’t quite shake the feeling of dread at what he was about to say. When the cheering finally subsided after the end of his long-winded speech about “Freedoms never Forgotten,” he finally took out his extra sheet of paper. The smile slowly crumbled off his face as he looked out at the crowd, addressing them once more with a tone one might call shaken.\n\n“Now... Today, I have one final announcement to make. It is with great pride that I have served as your...” He droned on for about ten minutes of how grateful he was to be the President, and how great the people were, and how amazing America was, yes, yes, everyone gets the message, but then he made his final statement; this one didn’t so much resonate with cheers as it did with stunned silence from some and appalled gasps from others..."

Mixed handful of candidates.\n\nThe Republicans obviously had a “fun” experience this go around; with Quayle rather suddenly and unexpectedly dropping his bid for reelection, there was a sudden demand for candidates from all wings and sides of the party, go figure, and a demand that needed to be met quickly lest the entire party fall into disarray. The Senate and House Whips got together everything the party had for the upcoming elections, and there was already contention over the main attraction, the big question that would define the party’s direction for the next while to come: Who would be our candidate?\n\nWith Quayle out, two main contenders came to the forefront of the party; obviously, there was always going to be a man with the name Bush on the stage so long as the dynasty lived on, Texas Governor George W. Bush–heir to the Bush Family legacy of Republican frontrunners. Of course, while Bush was an obvious pick for the party by merit of his name alone, he was far from uncontested; the Republican party had been gripping with itself over whether or not having Dynasties was a healthy facet for a democratically elected political entity, especially one that had just barely started to recover from the funk of the last member of such a dynasty. Though Bush had the voice and weight of a political champion of the continuation of his Father’s policies, some in the party would rather have stood behind someone a bit less rough around the edges. Someone who was less present because of a dynasty and more because of his popularity, even barring aside all conventions.\n\nThat man was of course Arizona Senator John McCain, a man who had made a name for himself as a rather bipartisan worker known for his efforts at Electoral Reform with bills that crossed over the party line to make effective change. McCain was a rather popular man, and he spoke on a very moderate platform that offered stability and compromise in a time of tension and divide, a voice that spoke not so much as stringently Republican as much as “Republican.” Which of course led to accusations that McCain was so much a true Republican as he was a chocolate milkshake–with the hardliners, Reaganites, and even the party’s more Laissez-Faire wing all decrying the man as a “Republican in Name Only.”\n\nIn the end, only one side could become the true successor to Quayle, and when the end of the Convention finally came to pass, the Republican delegates had decided to stand behind..."

Mixed handful of candidates.\n\nWhen the Democrats came together, there was the same question on the table as had at the last two elections that came to the forefront: do we put in Clinton? Clinton had been running Arkansas rather successfully for quite some time, even if only by proxy of his electorally appointed friend to the position... Not a particularly flattering position to be in for the awash candidate. And there was also the issue that he had already lost twice in a row, the second time more spectacularly than the first, and now he was only on the downhill. Losing two elections in a row and being blamed for eight more years of Republican dominance takes a heavy toll on a man, and the disheveled, growingly anxious Clinton was no longer looking as healthy of a choice to the DNC, between his growing ranting and raving, his continuous belief that someone was out to get him, and his seemingly paranoid delusion that the Bush’s had bugged his family’s home. Clinton wasn’t seemingly the man anymore for the ticket, and everyone, even his more ardent supporters, knew it. There was of course an alternative; Gore.\n\nAl Gore had run with Clinton twice for his chance at becoming the Vice President; a soft-spoken man with big plans and bigger ambitions to quite literally change the very fabric of the American nation’s economy from the ground up, running on a platform akin to that of the Greens, at least economically and environmentally. Environmental regulations, funding to fight Climate Change, a shift away from American heavy-industry in the burgeoning age of technology, Gore was seemingly the radical the Democrats needed to shake up the grounds that had become soiled with complacency.\n\nHe had the face, he had the plans, but did he have the support? He, like Clinton, had just lost two elections in a row, and the Democrats hadn’t been much for dipping their toes in meddling with the jobs of American industrial workers, especially since much of their vote came from the blue-collar working class up until very recently, and more so because of how fragile it seemed the American economy was at the time. Gore’s chances of victory were far from guaranteed, even if he were to win the Conventions.\n\nGore would have to fight, but with the backing of Connecticut Democrat Joe Lieberman, there was just a chance he could work it all out; Quayle’s departure could just break the armor of the Republican Party, and he was the best they had on the stage at the time of the votes.

Rather than the Democrats with their one major frontrunner, and the Republicans with a rather restricted menu, the Reform party had neither a long-standing political position, or a political candidate from a long line to choose from; they were a young party, and Perot himself hadn’t ordained any official successors in the wake of his growing age and distance from direct political involvement. There was quite a bit of contention then between the Left and the Right wing of the party; the moderates and the radicals; a hodgepodge of politics.\n\nOn one hand, Conservative Patrick Buchanan was a strong frontrunner for the party, with a history behind him of being an advocate for the Republicans for much of his life, though was now disillusioned with the Quayle administration after it took a turn away from the Reagan era conservatism he was so attached to. There was also John Hagelin, who worked on behalf of the American branch of the Transcendental Meditation movement, which was based on the pseudo-religious teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. And then to round it all off, there was New York Playboy, multimillionaire and businessman Donald J. Trump, a television personality who was known for his own brand of steaks, vodka, and his highrise towers, but also for being a stark advocate for the Perot plan and its continued implementation. Alongside several other minor members, the Reform party itself was a disorganized and unstructured mess of ideologies, beliefs, systems, and of course direction.\n\nOf the three frontrunners for the party, Buchanan and Trump were the only serious candidates, and the backrunners of the party ranging from open Communists to full on Neo-Nazis didn’t get in much edgewise, which at the very least helped to concentrate the party on something for once, but even then the battle was neck-at-neck. While Buchanan had the political legacy to back up his claim, many doubted how committed he was to the Reform ticket due to his Republican past, and Trump’s sudden jump onto the political stage left him short of legitimacy due to his past as a hipster and a trendsetter more than a politician, known more for wrestling and steaks than anything else.

The day went by slowly at first, but as time went on, things seemingly got worse and worse; the polls were all over the place, many states took hours longer than predicted to get proper counts on their votes, and some accusations of fraudulent voting went around in Florida over the punch-cards they used, though these were quickly settled in legal battles over the course of the next few weeks.\n\nThe day came, and the day went, because, frankly, there was nothing to be said on that day: the counts were taking too long to call on election day alone, and the battle for the vote, through the courts, through the Electoral College, and finally the media, was rife with conflict and elongated beyond reasonability. The results for the states were none too surprising, and even the electoral college didn’t give too much of a shock, but the popular vote was all over the place! Many states even began to question the ballots once they’d realized that in many of the swing states, it was an almost even three way split. Convention had been thrown out the window quite a while back with the previous election, but things seemingly were devolving more and more into crazed delirium as time went on.\n\nBut of course, things eventually did get straight enough for an answer to be produced; it was an unpopular answer, it would have to be, as the votes seemingly were stacked against any singular candidate, with none being able to win out the solid majority, but able to win out a partial set over one another. The people waited on the edges of their seats, and the Senate waited at the edge of their patience, as the electoral college cast the last of its votes.

To deal with this situation permanently (albeit in a controversial way) Milosevic has decided to abolish Bosnia as a republic. The former territories of Bosnia has been divided between Croat and Muslim Bosniaks as autonomus provinces, with the regions where Serbs are prominent directly joining the Serbian SR. Sadly, Our perfect solution has been met with lots of protests and resistance by the Bosniaks and the Croats, which are currently has been immediately supressed using the milicja."

 yug_milosevic.9.d:0 "As the integration of former PCPoY politicians continue. Many nationalist have formed their own faction inside of SKJ. Dubbed the "National Faction" due to claiming that they represent the national interests of Serbians across Yugoslavia. Led by the Bosnian-Serb nationalist Radovan Karadzic, it has a sizeable popularity inside SKJ despite getting critized for blant nationalism by other SKJ politicians. \n\nThe faction is closely watched by security service to make sure they dont plot anything against Milosevic like the late Seselj."

Factories and infrastructure are outdated and some roads are even unconnected. The internet structure is almost nonexistant. Thats why theres in need of a new, great campaign to carry yugoslavia up to modern standards.\n\nThis campaign, the great progress campaign will focus on improving Yugoslavia's industry and its technoligical advancements. We will divert large amounts of the budget to ensure the program goes smoothly."

 yug_milosevic.11.d:0 "As the next stage of the great progress campaign continues, the work on the internet of Yugoslavia has started. Along with a general improvement of the Yugoslav internet infrastructure, theres another front we can work on: personal computers. Computer development in Yugoslavia had a good history until being inturrepted due to Croatia and Slovenia -regions with a great amount of computer technitians- left Yugoslavia and later having difficulties due to the situation of the Yugoslav economy. Thankfully, we can once again focus on this front as a part of the Great Progress Campaign. To help us with this task we have recruited a team of technitians with a goal of designing a computer, led by Voja Antonić, a computer designer and inventor of the Galaksija computer. Although Antonic had some ideological disagreements with the government, few concessions had to be provided for him to agree. With the team being assambled, the work on the computer can officially begin."

While this neutrality is protected by our military, it was clearly shown to us with Croatian and Slovene parts of the military leaving Yugoslavia in 1991 that even the military isnt reliable to protect Yugoslavia against a large invasion. With the threat of NATO and USSR intervening in our affairs increasing as well. That is why, Yugoslavia shall begin the research of nuclear weaponery and arm itself as quickly as possible to protect it against any foreign invasions.\n\nAnyone that dare tries to violate our neutrality will taste the power of the atom."

We can implement a new law to ensure stability against seperatist elements in the socialist republics. This new law, "National Security and Unity Law" gives Belgrade the permission to fire, replace, and arrests politicians that "harbors seperatist views". NSaUL also gives permission for the JNA free reign in anti-insurgent operations, allowing them to enter any of the socialist republics.\n\nWhile the law was passed with a majority, multiple people in the republics have critized the law for its authoritarianism."

A week of mourning has been declared in memory of him. In the halls of power however, a question on who to succeed him is being discussed, considering the impact of Milosevics in Yugoslavia, the emergency committee made up of people appointed by Mirjana Milosevic have decided to appoint Milosevic's son, Marko Milosevic to power. Although having a criminal history that continues to this day, the commitee has seen him fit to rule. He's our great leader Milosevic's son afterall!"

 yug_seselj.3.t:0 "The Repopulation Program"
 yug_seselj.3.d:0 "Its pretty evident that if we want a mostly pure Greater Serbia, we require fewer ethnic minorities that are troublemakers. The most effective approach to address this issue would be to deport the numerous minority groups and impose taxes on those who remain. However, without a sufficient number of Serbs to replace them, this plan would ultimately fail. That is why, after extensive discussions, Seselj has decided to introduce a 10% tax on unmarried Serbian men and women over the age of 25 who do not have any children. This measure aims to enhance birth rates and, within 10 years, establish Serbian majority in multiple regions."
 yug_seselj.3.a:0 "Approved, for a pure Serbia!"
 yug_seselj.4.t:0 ""Fair" Elections in the Republics"
 yug_seselj.4.d:0 "With the end of Authoritarian Communism in Yugoslavia, the people can finally experience real elections at last! Just as Seselj promised, free elections have been initiated in the republics. Armed soldiers and local volunteers approved directly by the government have been put on the voting stations across the nation to safeguard the voting process from any voting fraud.\n\n As the voting process finishes, the results cleaarly show us that Pro-Serb parties across Yugoslavia has won the elections with the votes they receive usually being over 90%. Multiple protests have broken out, denouncing the election for being "unfair". These protests will be quickly dealt using the milicja for trying to destroy stability of Yugoslavia."
 yug_seselj.4.a:0 "Now we have the political legitimacy."
 yug_seselj.5.t:0 "Mass Protests"
 yug_seselj.5.d:0 "Seselj's announcement to officially centralize all republics to Belgrade has been faced with extreme backlash from the population and led ot mass protests breaking out in the major cities shortly after the announcement. The protestors have made multiple demands, such as the resignation of the Seselj government and the rolling back of the many Pro-Serb laws made by our government. Along with the release of politicians arrested on ideological grounds. These demands will of course wont be met as Seselj has directly denounced the protestors for being "foolish troublemakers that dont know how to govern a country". The Milicja forces have been sent to crackdown on the protestors. Although effective in supressing, it unfortunately had the side effect of causing major infrastructure damage along with deaths of some protestors."

 yug_seselj.6.d:0 "It was 20:00, at night just like usual, it was calm and dull. As people were spending time at their homes, a television address was going to be made directly by the new president, Vojislav Seselj. As people tuned in to their TV's many awaited with bated breath. It was unclear what many of the new government's agenda was and where Milosevic was even after getting couped by his former ally. These thoughs of the citizens were cut short as the Tv adress begun showing Seselj before a podium with the flag of Yugoslavia flag...without the red star many are used to.\n\nSeselj thus begun his speech; "Dear people of Yugoslavia, I am Vojislav Seselj. The president of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia had a very turbulant history, a history of terrorism, a history of instability, a history of forced unity. Yugoslavia has been tainted by Communism and Tito. For our country to progress, it shall officially abondon Communism and move away from Tito's legacy. The Patriotic Communist Party of Yugoslavia will be rebranded, for it was merely us playing an act to gain positions in the government of Milosevic and spread our message more easily. The country's name will be officially changed to Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with a new flag to commemorate this change. Long live Serbia!""
 yug_seselj.6.a:0 "Chaos was common for the next few days."
 yug_seselj.7.t:0 "Foundation of the New Communist Party of Yugoslavia"
 yug_seselj.7.d:0 "Shortly after the ban of SKJ and mass arrests of communist politicians, those who have survived decided to not simply stand aside and stay silent. These people have united under a new unified single movement led by Branko Kitanović. This movement, New Communist Party of Yugoslavia's goal is to rage an insurgency against the government of Seselj and restore an anti-revisionist communist Yugoslavia that is harsh against nationalism. While small at the moment with only a few militants, they still threaten our rule and stability, security services have already been tasked with supressing NCPY and arrest any sympathisers."

This decision haven been taken due to a multitade of reasons, repeated human rights violations, disregard for stability. The core values of the IMF revolve around promoting economic stability, growth, and development in a manner that respects human rights and fosters inclusive societies. However, the persistent disregard for these fundamental principles in Yugoslavia has forced us to reassess our involvement.\n\nWe remain open to reevaluating this decision in the event of substantial and demonstrable improvements in the areas of concern. It is our earnest hope that Yugoslavia will take urgent and decisive steps towards fostering a more inclusive and rights-respecting society, not just for the sake of international cooperation but, more importantly, for the well-being and dignity of its citizens."\n\nThe letter was soon thorn into multiple pieces of paper as it went through the shredder in the presidental office."

However it does have its trade-offs, as this will almost certainly end any opportunities at us reaching out to other non-aligned powers, in exchange for our increased bonds with the Soviets, as well as causing further popularity problems amongst our populace due to much of the government supporting neutrality.\n\nThe alternative to this is favored by most of our coalition government, that being neutrality. This serves us the possibility of becoming more open to less hostile spheres of the globe, such as other left powers or nations who are against the capitalist powers of the west like us.

 yug_start.1.d:0 "During these past years, life for our leader Slobodan Milosevic, politically, has been...rough. The current situation within the congress of the SKJ can be simplified as a “wrong plan for the wrong state” sort of dilemma, with a messy coalition of parties existing solely to keep the country from collapse, facing an opposition who is rising in popularity. So it would be best if the current situation was simplified.\n\nWithin the broad government coalition lies 3 main factions, the Libertarian Left SLPoY faction led by the wife of our leader, Mirjana Milosevic, the current market socialist SKJ - M faction leading the country led by Milosevic himself, and the hardline "leftist" PCPoY faction led by serbian ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj.\n\nThe SLPoY drives the messages of a more libertarian form of socialism, supporting a more market socialist driven economy, more traditional leftist forms of nationalism, and a more moderate view on Serbian nationalism. Despite the messaging of the party, it is mostly seen as a shining example of nepotism, due to the leader of the party being the wife of Slobodan himself.\n\nThe current leading faction, the SKJ - M, serves to keep the current government trends going and restore the glory of the former Yugoslavia. The current head of the party Milosevic has been previously catastrophic to the stability of the nation, as his tendencies at Serbian nationalist-favoring legislation and actions brought upon a majority of the calamities of which we suffer from today, such as the Croatian-Slovenian cessation, ethnic divides, and a lot of the government disunity which made Milosevic form the coalition in the first place.\n\nThe last and most interesting faction of the SKJ are the PCPoY, led by the infamous Vojislav Seselj. Known for his past as a Serbian ultranationalist, he has managed to make his way to the top of the, currently, most influential faction of the congress, supporting the idea of National Communism, greater Serb nationalism, and a command-style economy. Many other leftist members of the party criticize Seselj’s role in the coalition as hypocritical, with some thinking he won't be so hesitant to change his mind on leftism."

This plan has been outright rejected by NYL that claimed the new constitution gave too much power to Milosevic. Although with the power of coalition parties, we can safely pass this constitution.

 vin_intro.1.t:0 "Socialist Republic of Vietnam"
 vin_intro.1.d:0 "Vietnam is located in a region considered a cradle of mankind, one of the earliest agricultural centers practicing wet rice farming, where the stone and metallurgical revolutions took place.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Western capitalist countries entered the period of imperialism and colonialism. Through missionaries and trade, the French gradually dominated Vietnam. For the first time in history, Vietnam had to cope with the invasion of a Western industrial country. In that context, some Vietnamese intellectuals were aware of the need to carry out reforms, bringing the country out of stagnation and save national independence. Many reform plans were proposed, yet rejected by the Nguyen Dynasty. Subsequently, the country was driven into backwardness and deadlock and became a semi-feudal colony for nearly 100 years from 1858 to 1945.\n\nThe founding of the Communist Party of Vietnam on 3 February 1930 was an important milestone in the Vietnamese history. In August 1945, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people successfully launched an uprising to seize power and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam came into being on 2 September 1945.\n\nThe newly founded Vietnam had to go through another 30-year-long struggle for national liberation and reunification. Dien Bien Phu victory and Geneva Accord in 1954 put an end to the war of resistance against the French colonialists. According to the Accord, the country was temporarily separated along the 17th Parallel North into two territories, North Vietnam and the South Vietnam, which were expected to be reunified two years later with a general election. South Vietnam was ruled by a pro-French and then pro-USA government in Saigon. Though Saigon regime attempted to prevent reunification, it failed to subdue peace and national reunification campaigns. As a result, the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam was founded on December 20 1964.\n\nBetween 1954 and 1975, Vietnam had to stand up for national liberation and unification. To support the South Vietnam regime, the US sent military aid and over half a million soldiers to Vietnam, and started bombing North Vietnam in 1964. To fulfill President Ho Chi Minh’s apiration that "nothing is more precious than independence and freedom", the Vietnamese people experienced untold hardship and sacrifice. In 1973, the Paris Accord was signed for restoration of peace in Vietnam and withdrawal of the US troops. The war came to an end in spring 1975 as the patriotic armed forces launched an offensive against the Saigon regime, liberated southern Vietnam and reunified the country. Since then, the unified Vietnam has ushered into a new era of peace, unification and national construction. Democratic Republic of Vietnam was renamed Socialist Republic of Vietnam on April 25 1976."

That is the sacred and triumphant victory of the revolution and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\n\nIn 1945, Japan surrendered to the Allies. Both the Chinese and British forces that arrived to disarm the Japanese were not favorable for the Vietnamese revolution. The British handed Vietnam back to the French, while the Chinese had dangerous intentions in the short and long term. The Vietnamese revolution faced three types of enemies: hunger, ignorance, and foreign invaders! The situation was truly as delicate as 'a thousand pounds hanging by a hair'.\n\nFrom here onwards, our struggle against internal foes and foreign invaders is the struggle for "Vietnam's right to enjoy freedom and independence. At that time, the people of Vietnam were citizens of an independent and free nation, no longer enslaved by feudalism and colonialism, the revolutionary faith, the stature of the Vietnamese people's participation in the revolution, had reached a new level. The young Democratic Republic of Vietnam was the aspiration of the Vietnamese people, so the unity of the community cannot be shaken; it is the strength of that state.\n\nThe democratic republican were indeed quite new to a nation where over 90% of the population was illiterate, and who were grappling with hunger and hardship. However, none of these could hinder the determination and aspiration for freedom and independence of the country and the belief in a state by the people and for the people.The people had a deep understanding and grew weary of the colonial feudal regime. They could no longer endure a life under the unjust "double yoke", with unreasonable, immoral practices that had persisted for nearly a century. "Better to sacrifice all than to endure slavery, to lose the fatherland!" was not just a slogan; it was the will and desire of our people. Therefore, there was no comparable strength, no force capable of obstructing this will.\n\nToday, fellow citizens, let us honor the heroic struggles and remember our fallen heroes. The August month, with its faith and hope, continues to illuminate the spirits of the Vietnamese people, empowering us to stay steadfast on the path of freedom, independence, democracy, and prosperity."

The real estate market faced a crisis in 1998 after a period of excessive overheating.\n\nSimilar to many other businesses, Minh Phung aimed to swiftly seize the opportunity, accumulating as much land as possible, anticipating a chance to sell at a higher price. From the outset, Minh Phung determined to invest on a large scale. The overly heated growth prompted Minh Phung to invest in various types of real estate in multiple locations. With ample capital, the ability to retain land while still repaying bank loans, and waiting for the next growth cycle in the real estate market, Minh Phung could potentially reap significant profits. However, if the entire asset block is built on borrowed capital, assuming waiting for the next boom, the profit obtained may struggle to offset the interest on both the principal and the subsidiary loans, perhaps signaling a tragedy unfolding from this point onward. The collapse of the chain left Minh Phung incapable of repaying bank loans.\n\nHe and his accomplices were sentenced for crimes of fraud, abuse of trust leading to the misappropriation of state property, and intentional violation causing serious consequences.\n\nThis is a significant victory for our country, successfully dismantling a capitalist tycoon with the potential for robust development and economic disruption in the future."

Transitioning from a primarily agrarian economy, the country embarked on its path towards socialism, bypassing the capitalist stage.\n\nDuring this period, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) made mistakes, including serious ones, in its leadership. These errors were driven by dogmatism, subjectivity, and a deviation from objective principles. In the process of social construction and transformation, we failed to fully grasp the instructions provided by Marx and Engels. Specifically, we did not fully comprehend the essence of the argument that "communists can summarize their theory in this single phrase: the abolition of the private ownership regime." Instead, we mistakenly equated the eradication of the private ownership regime with the elimination of private forms of ownership and private ownership of property.\n\The truth is that Communism does not abolish individuals' ownership of social products; rather, it eliminates the possibility of using such ownership to enslave others. The essence of communism lies in eradicating the private ownership regime that facilitates the "exploitation of humans by humans" and the use of ownership to subjugate others, rather than eradicating the existence of private forms of ownership.\n\nUnfortunately, due to this misunderstanding, we attempted to eliminate forms of ownership beyond state ownership and collective ownership. This approach posed significant challenges and resulted in a severe economic and social crisis in the late 1970s and early 1980s."

The Council's primary role is to advise the Party on policies and practices, particularly in ensuring that the new generation of leaders stays true to the principles of Marxism-Leninism.\n\nWhile the leaders of the Central Committee's Advisors are no longer directly involved in governing and directing state affairs, they still hold positions within the Politburo and possess significant influence in Vietnam's collective leadership. This dynamic has unintentionally created tensions between the new and old generations of leaders, causing delays in certain reforms. Consequently, there have been calls from some party members to abolish the Advisory Council.\n\nOn the other hand, many Party members support the Advisory Council due to concerns over the rising tide of revisionism following the collapse of the communist bloc in Eastern Europe. The fear of deviating from Marxist-Leninist principles is prevalent, and there is uncertainty regarding the possibility of a similar upheaval to the August coup in the Soviet Union taking place in Vietnam."

Under the banner of the 1991 Platform, the Party has led our people firmly to overcome many turbulences and dangerous challenges, to win many victories in the process of Doi Moi, industrialization, and modernization, bringing our country to continue gradually transitioning to socialism with new perceptions and thoughts that are correct and consistent with the reality of Vietnam.\n\nToday, our country is translating to socialism in the international context has undergone many great and profound changes with the salient feature of the era that countries fierce competition for national interests. The struggle of the peoples of different countries for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress, despite many difficulties and challenges, will have new progress. The international context and reality of our country's revolution require our Party to maintain its orientation, and at the same time supplement and develop the 1991 Platform to suit the development requirements of the country in the new period. Socialism is the aspiration of our people, the right choice of the Communist Party of Vietnam and President Ho Chi Minh. The socialist society that our people build is a society of wealthy people, strong country, democracy, justice and civilization; owned by the people; having a highly developed economy based on modern productive forces and public ownership of the main means of production\n\nThe overall goal at the end of the transition period in our country is to complete the construction of the economic foundation of socialism with the appropriate political, ideological and cultural superstructure, creating the foundation for our country to become an increasingly prosperous socialist country. From now until the middle of the twenty-first century, our entire Party and people must strive to build our country into a modern industrialized, socialist-oriented country.\n\nTo successfully implement the above-mentioned objectives, it is necessary to thoroughly grasp and effectively implement the following basic directions: accelerating the industrialization and modernization of the country in association with the development of the knowledge economy, and developing a socialist-oriented market economy.

As a result, a food crisis occurred, and there was a risk of a potential famine. Fortunately, thanks to food aid from China, this scourge was averted.

The streets are filled with posters, public loudspeakers constantly encouraging people to vote, mobile ballot boxes lying on bicycle saddles occasionally appear on the streets, and polling stations are crowded.\n\nThe main campaign issue was the fight against corruption, at all levels of society, as increasingly widespread corruption and the wealth of senior officials had become a major cause of dissatisfaction for voters. The media were full of revelations as to links between high-level police officers and party officials and well-known organized crime figures. In addition, three Communist Party officials were disqualified from the final list of candidates, one of them being linked to a major underworld figure who is in jail on murder charges. During the electoral campaign, party and State leaders vowed to do their utmost to ensure that the 11th National Assembly conducted its business efficiently, and the Communist Party leader described corruption as the number one poll issue.\n\nThe elections were seen as significant because for the first time, at least a quarter of the deputies will be full-time, and the candidates contesting seats were younger and with higher academic qualifications than in previous elections.

Marxism-Leninism has shown oppressed nations the path to self-liberation.

He emphasized that without the consent and support of the majority of the working people, led by the vanguard of the proletariat, the socialist revolution cannot be achieved.\n\nHo Chi Minh's ideology on national unity reflects his perspectives, positions, worldview, philosophy of life, and scientific revolutionary methods of Marxism-Leninism, which are concretized into points, principles, methods of gathering, mobilizing, and harnessing the strength of various social classes, organizing revolutionary forces, and fostering international solidarity to maximize the immense power of national unity.\n\nHe emphasizes that the greatest strength lies in the people, stating that "there is nothing more precious in the sky than the people, and in the world, there is nothing stronger than the united forces of the people." Unity among the people will generate the greatest strength. He affirms that "national unity means first and foremost the unity of the majority of the people, of which the majority of our people are workers, peasants, and other working classes. This is the foundation of national unity, like the foundation of a house, the root of a tree. Once the foundation is solid, the good root is established, we must also unite with other working classes. Anyone who honestly advocates peace, unity, independence, and democracy, even if they were once our adversaries, we must sincerely unite with them." Ho Chi Minh stresses that national unity is not only the top objective and task of the Party but also the top objective and task of the entire nation.\n\nThe renewal policy has initiated a new era of building and strengthening national unity based on the ideology of Ho Chi Minh. It involves innovating economic thinking, proposing the direction of developing a multi-sectoral economy where the state-owned economy plays a leading role, valuing the legitimate and lawful interests of laborers, aiming to link and harness the potential of all social strata in the nation-building and defense. It means paying more attention to "class policies, including policies for each class and policies to handle the relationship between class interests and national policies," emphasizing the placement of human beings at the center of economic and social policies, "proactively planning the development of the class structure of the new society, concretizing and properly implementing national and religious freedom policies."

He has left behind a comprehensive and profound system of viewpoints on the fundamental issues of the Vietnamese revolution, which encompasses the dual goals of achieving true national independence and addressing democratic issues thoroughly while liberating the working people from oppression and exploitation. The central and consistent standpoint to resolve both these issues, according to President Ho Chi Minh, is that national independence is inherently linked with socialism. Thus, the issue of the nation must be tackled according to the perspective of the proletariat.\n\nOver the past century, under the leadership of the Party and the principle of linking national independence with socialism, the Vietnamese nation has achieved monumental and historically significant victories.\n\nHowever, there have recently been arguments that the ideology of Ho Chi Minh is essentially "nationalism.". It removes an adjective that not only alters the meaning of the Vietnamese language but also erases perfection and distorts a concept.\n\nThe issue of the nation is always intertwined with class issues. Nationalism always defends interests based on the standpoint of a certain class. There is no non-class-based nationalism, no vague nationalism; history has shown that since the appearance of nations until now, the dominant class representative of the mode of production has always held the power of national dominance. The ruling class of the nation always solves national issues, protects independence, autonomy, and the nation's development according to its class image and interests. Thus, nationalism, with its nature as a political ideology and psychology demanding independent, self-reliant, and national development rights, always depends on the standpoint and viewpoint of the ruling class of the nation.\n\nConnected to the ruling classes that have held power over the nation are corresponding methods to protect the nation's independence, autonomy, and development, as well as resolve national issues. The feudal, bourgeois, and proletarian classes perceive and resolve national issues differently. Throughout history, traditional nationalist ideology has shown a long-standing patriotism of a nation; bourgeois nationalist ideology, proletarian nationalist ideology, revolutionary nationalist ideology, large nation socialist nationalist ideology, narrow nationalist ideology... There is no non-class-based nationalism. There hasn't been, and as long as there are classes, there won't be non-class-based nationalism. Nationalism always carries a class nature; nationalism always has an "adjective," as mentioned.\n\nIt is also essential to note that President Ho Chi Minh was attentive to the class essence when referring to nationalism. From the early years of embracing Marxism-Leninism, he clearly distinguished "native nationalism" - traditional nationalism in colonized countries - from "international nationalism" - nationalism following the perspective of the proletarian class. He wrote, "Nationalism is a driving force for the nation... Mobilizing native nationalism on behalf of International Communism... When their nationalism wins... that nationalism will undoubtedly transform into international nationalism." He always emphasized that when dealing with national issues, one must stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, actively combat bourgeois nationalism, petty-bourgeois nationalism, as well as religious nationalism and revisionist nationalism.\n\nTherefore, asserting that Ho Chi Minh's ideology is essentially "nationalism" is an inaccurate and incomplete expression. This expression, whether intentionally or unintentionally, overlooks the class nature, obscures President Ho Chi Minh's standpoint and viewpoint on class issues in perceiving and resolving national issues in Vietnam. This expression strips away the revolutionary essence, the most progressive aspect of Ho Chi Minh's ideology, and diminishes Ho Chi Minh's ideology itself. As V.I. Lenin once warned, "Until they learn to distinguish the interests of these or those classes from those of other classes behind any sayings, any declarations, any promises that are of a moral, religious, political, or social nature, they will always be fools deceived by others and by themselves in politics.""

The leadership transition has garnered significant attention, with two standout candidates vying for the position.\n\nThe first candidate, Nguyen Van An, is a seasoned revolutionary with a track record of dedication and service. His pragmatic and sagacious policies have earned him widespread support from both reformists and conservatives alike. Nguyen Van An's ability to strike a balance between various factions within the party underscores his suitability for the role of General Secretary.\n\nOn the other hand, the second candidate, Nguyen Phu Trong, has gained prominence for his unwavering commitment to modernizing the administrative apparatus. His pledge to root out corruption and enhance transparency within the Party has resonated with many members. Nguyen Phu Trong brings a dynamic vision for reform, emphasizing the need for a clean and efficient governance structure.\n\nAs the congress voting approaches, the choice between these two candidates symbolizes a crossroads for the party. Nguyen Van An embodies continuity and a balanced approach, while Nguyen Phu Trong represents a potential for radical transformation and a crackdown on corruption. The decision made during this election will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of the party and the nation's future."

This committee will bear responsibility to the Politburo and the Central Committee in directing, coordinating, inspecting, and promoting anti-corruption and anti-negative activities nationwide.\n\nBy creating this Central Steering Committee and placing it under the leadership of Comrade General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, the government aims to address corruption more effectively and send a strong signal that corrupt practices will not be tolerated.\n\nThe committee's tasks will likely include investigating and prosecuting corrupt officials, implementing preventive measures, enhancing transparency in government operations, and fostering a culture of integrity within the public sector."

 vin.44.t:0 "Revisionism In Vietnam"
 vin.44.d:0 "In Vietnam, revisionism lacks economic, political, and socio-cultural foundations to exist as an "ism." Instead, it exists as a viewpoint, an unstructured and inconsistent set of thoughts expressed through words, writings, and actions of certain individuals and non-legal organizations. In the 1930s, a notable group of these revisionists, including figures like Ta Thu Thau, Tran Van Thach, Phan Van Hum, opposed the policies of the Indochinese Communist Party, simultaneously employing slogans and tactics to deceive and attract the masses, creating the illusion that they were revolutionaries. This was essentially opportunistic political maneuvering.\n\nTimely criticism and struggle against the subversive activities of these revisionist groups in Vietnam were led by Nguyen Ai Quoc, who stated, "The Trotskyites are not only enemies of communism but also enemies of democracy and progress. They are the worst traitors and spies." Especially in the early 1980s, when our nation faced profound economic and social crises, our Party initiated the renewal process. During this period of immense national difficulties, some individuals outwardly endorsed renewal but deviated from socialist principles. They abandoned the socialist orientation by advocating for "changing direction and mindset," which amounted to a form of ideological betrayal.\n\nPresently, despite the achievements, we also have many limitations and shortcomings. In the international and regional context, there are latent destabilizing factors, and hostile forces are intensifying their efforts to undermine the Vietnamese revolution. This provides fertile ground for revisionist ideas to reemerge like "mushrooms after the rain,".\n\nIn the face of significant challenges and the slow resolution of some of our nation's problems, certain revisionist elements argue that the Communist Party of Vietnam erred in choosing the socialist path. They view "Marxism-Leninism as mere propaganda and an ideal, which must be abandoned." They contend that Marxism-Leninism was just a means to an end, and now that the objective of national independence has been achieved, it should be abandoned.\n\nThe common tactics of revisionist elements include distortion, vilification, and the deliberate misrepresentation of our history, especially the glorious achievements of the Vietnamese revolution. Some intellectuals, including historians, have been compromised, abandoning their class perspective, their Party, and their objectivity when studying history. They intentionally "rewrite history," "de-sanctify historical figures," denigrate the Party, and speak ill of the Communist Party of Vietnam. At the same time, they romanticize and promote those who collaborated with the enemy, those who owe a blood debt to our people, and so on.\n\nThese issues highlight the resurgence of revisionist thought in Vietnam today, posing a real threat that needs to be acknowledged and countered in a timely manner."

 vin.45.t:0 "On Critism and Self-Critism In The Party"
 vin.45.d:0 "Since the foundation of the first international communist organisation, self-criticism and criticism has been credited by the founders of Marxism-Leninism as essential for the operation and development of the party, the nature of a revolutionary party. This is because in the process of evolution and development, weaknesses and defects arising within the Party are inevitable. Struggling to solve those problems and create high unity is very necessary, but this should absolutely not be done through violence or purge, but through self-criticism and criticism. Lenin considered self-criticism and criticism the immutable law of the development of a genuine and revolutionary party. He said:"Revolutionary parties perished because of egoism. They did not see clearly what made their strength and hesitated to speak of their weaknesses. As for us, we will not perish, because we are not afraid to speak about our weaknesses and we will learn the way to overcome them”. And that party officials and members are also human, not “angels, not saints, not heroes, but human like everyone else. They do have flaws. The Party will correct them".\n\nHowever, while exercising self-criticism and criticism, most party members have not yet fully recognized their shortcomings and mistakes but often shifted responsibility to collective and objective causes.Criticism must be done basing on comradeship and mutual love. Honest and sincere self-criticism and self-criticism are always the criteria for assessing the attitude, motivation, personality and morality of each cadre and party member. In order to make it effective, it is compulsory that democracy be promoted; people are encouraged to speak out their opinion about cadres; and subordinates are encouraged to comment and criticise their superiors, not just top-down criticism. Only by this way will democracy be promoted, and criticism be fully and effectively implemented.\n\nWe must never forget what President Ho Chi Minh has taught us:"A party that conceals its flaws is a corrupt party. A party that boldly acknowledges its shortcomings, outlines them, understands why those flaws exist, examines the circumstances that gave rise to those flaws, and then seeks every way to rectify those shortcomings is a progressive, courageous, confident, and sincere party.""
 vin.45.a:0 "From Central to Grassroots Level"
 vin.46.t:0 "Our Goal"
 vin.46.d:0 ""What is socialism, and how shall we advance to socialism?” That is the question the Communist Party of Vietnam is always pondering, deliberating, investigating and weighing, in order to gradually improve our guideline and viewpoint, and organize for their implementation, so as to both observe the general law and satisfy the particular conditions in Vietnam. As we are well aware that socialism is usually understood in three aspects:socialism as a doctrine, socialism as a movement, and socialism as a polity. Each aspect has different manifestations, depending on the world outlook and development level in a specific historical period. The socialism as referred to in this writing is a scientific socialism, based on Marxism - Leninism in the world today. How, then, shall we define socialism and chart the course towards socialism, in a manner suitable to the particular condition and characteristics in Vietnam?\n\nPreviously, while the Soviet Union and its constellation of socialist countries existed in the world, the question of advancing towards socialism in Vietnam seemed beyond doubt and implicitly validated. However, after the collapse of the socialist model in many Eastern European countries and the decline of the world revolution, the advancement towards socialism was once again put into question and became the topic for every discussion, even drawing heated debate. Anti-communism and political opportunists rejoiced, and seized that opportunity to spread misinformation and subvert the movement. Within the revolutionary rank, there are also those who wallowed in pessimism and faltered. Some began to doubt the correctness and science of socialism, and blamed the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact on the errors of Marxism-Leninism and the choice of socialism as the way forward. From this premise, they believe we have chosen the wrong way and must march on another path. Some echoed the hostile arguments, disparaged and criticized socialism, and indulged in one-sided praise of capitalism. Some even claimed repentance for having had faith in Marxism-Leninism and socialism. But is this the truth? Is it true that capitalism today, including those long-standing capitalist countries, are still growing well? Has Vietnam chosen the wrong way?\n\nDuring the years of Doi Moi, based on the review of praxis and study of theory, the Communist Party of Vietnam has been gradually reaching a more complete and profound understanding of socialism and the transition into socialism. The Party has in stages addressed simplistic ideas the Party held previously, such as homogenizing the end goal of socialism with the task currently at hand, one-sidedly stressing production relations and equal distribution without fully realizing the need to develop the productive force in the transition period, not recognizing the existence of other economic sectors, putting the market economy in the same basket as capitalism, and viewing the rule-of-law state as the same as a bourgeois state...\n\nAs of today, while there remain areas for further study, the Communist Party of Vietnam has established an overarching understanding: The socialist society that the Vietnamese people are making all efforts to build is a society where the people are well-off, the nation is strong and the people are owners, a society characterized by democracy, equality and civilization. It possesses a highly developed economy on the basis of a modern productive force and suitable and progressive production relations. It enjoys an advanced culture imbued with national identity. Its people are entitled to wellbeing, freedom and happiness and are blessed with opportunities for comprehensive development. Ethnic groups in the Vietnamese community are equal, united, respectful and supportive of each other to grow together. It has a rule-of-law socialist state of the people, by the people and for the people."

At that moment looked like I was London, that place, full of life, people talking, while others were waiting for the train. I waited for some time, still bewildered by that place... The subway itself was very colourful, the walls full of images of Saddam, his Actions, and the great battles that Iraq fought bravely. While I got distracted looking at the paintings on the walls, the train arrives, and without even thinking about it I enter, and I take a seat. Inside the train there were many people, and all very cheerfully talked to each other, and while I was thinking about it, in less than 10 minutes I arrive at my destination, I was very amazed, the fastest train we had took 30 minutes just to leave. In any case, I decide to get off the train because I did not want to get too far from my house, so I simply wait for another train to return to the station I left from.

And there it was: a team of workers, pulling up to our neighbourhood in a truck loaded with generators and power lines.

It comes as no surprise then that with the introduction of opinions hostile to each other, a split has now occurred.\n\nWhile we have little information on the internal faction politics that are currently experiencing upheaval, it is clear that drastic action has been taken by certain key individuals, resulting in dozens of members being demoted or expelled, and faction loyalists taking their place. This split appears to have mostly affected two factions, with the subject in question being the opposing stances of those parties. As a result, while the internal politics of those factions appear to have been strengthened, their cooperation with each other has plummeted to all-time lows."

Luckily, I've never been alone, not in the recruiting barracks or the battlefield. My elder brother has always kept me company in this Hellhole, what our Generation calls "The Golden Age of Iraq." His name is Mustafa Al-Hamad.\n\nToday… today is one of the last, if not THE last battle we fight here in Saudi Arabia. That is the assault on the capital city. I have to admit that I've never been scared like this before. Nonetheless, I know that my brother is watching my back.\n\nI'd better rest for a couple of hours...\n\n8:22 A.M.\n\nWe are in the Motorized Division, "Lions of Tikrit." Sitting in the back of the Transport Truck, our entire company is heading towards Riyadh, the Saudi capital. I'm Scared... I feel my heart is about to explode…\n\n"Brother, Come on, we've done it before. Don't worry."\n\nMustafa, my brother, knows how I feel…\n\"You're Right… you're Right…" I answer him, muttering.\n\n"Do you remember what our Father used to say?" He asks me, with a very confident look and a smile on his face.\n\n"Strong and Courageous! Allah is always on the side of the Righteous. Fear not!" He completes the sentence, putting his arm around my neck to hug and hold me tight. My brother always gives me security and even today, he is no less of a help.\n\n8:32 A.M.\n\nTen minutes have passed since the last time someone opened his mouth. It's almost time.

I, my brother, and other men of our Division are advancing through the city with caution…\n\n"Kassim, Have you seen? Nothing to worry about, like I said."\n\n"Yes Mustafa… It's a relief…" And the moment I complete the sentence, a grenade lands at my feet…\n\n"Kassim!"\n\nMy brother kicks the grenade away, pushing me into one of the houses.\n\n"AMBUSH! TAKE COVER!" One of the soldiers of our platoon screams, taking cover at my side, while my brother is in the house next to ours.\n\n9:10 A.M.\n\nI hear shots, screams, and explosions. I haven't seen my brother for half an hour. I am very scared, but I am taking courage and doing my best to defend myself and the soldier by my side.\n\n9:20 A.M.\n\nI don't hear any more shots. The last Saudis are retreating... My combat partner and I listen carefully. We don't know what to do anymore…\n\nIt was at that moment that I decided to go out of hiding. There was nobody around, just scraps and burning piles of junk. I quickly ran to the house next to the one I was hiding, the last place I saw my brother...\n\nUpon entering, I saw…\n\nThere was an Iraqi soldier who had bled to death, and next to him my brother, with a single but precise blow to the stomach…\n\n"Mustafa!" I immediately jumped over to him, almost in tears\n\n"Haha… Kassim, Brother… We made It."\n\n"M-Mustafa…" At this point, I was already crying, seeing my brother dying.\n\n"Kassim…"\n\nHe begins spitting blood.\n\n"Be Strong.

It was clear that two were very different in this field.\n\n"I am not sure Abdu. This whole situation we got here is...complex to say the least. But I think that the old bastard Viljoen is the best choice we got. He's not the best but at least we can live normally." - said William.\n\n"Speak for yourself. I am the black one here. Well, at least serving in the army got me a better position in life. But that still doesn't excuse that the apartheid is still here. Hell, maybe Parliament guys have a point, they aren't all that better but maybe they are the only grace to save this country from an open civil war." - Abdu remarked.\n\n"I don't think so, but who gives a damn about our opinions." - William said as he begun drinking his beer.\n\n"You are right. I just hope it will be better, but as long as the pension is on time and I can drink with you, I am happy." - Abdu said before picking his bottle."

In order to strengthen the Government, it is to inculcate a little Sanity in the minds of those who still stubbornly Oppose Us.\n\nAfter reading the letter, Viljoen decided to organize a meeting as soon as possible, specifying that it will only be held as a formality, given his approval for this Coaliation.

How nice to meet you in person!" \n\nSays Botha, while he puts a hand on his shoulder and invites him to enter\n\n"I was looking forward to our meeting!" \n\nHe continues to Say, even before Viljoen can utter a word. \n\nBotha in a very friendly way guides Viljoen through the various rooms of his Palace, making him visit it, until they sit in the main hall to formalize their Coaliation \n\n"I hope you enjoyed the tour of my house Mr Constand. Anyway, it's time to talk about our "business." Would you like a glass of wine while we discuss?" \n\nBotha says, with a smile on his face since he saw Viljoen \n\n"Hm, That's fine by me, but I don't think it will take that long to officialize this." \n\nSays Viljoen, somewhat suspicious of Botha's behaviors, too friendly for a political meeting, and too kind for a man of his reputation. Viljoen was confused by this attitude, but still, he decided to trust him, a former president only wants the best for his country... right?\n\n"Do not worry! I insist!" \n\nSays Botha, as he orders one of the men in the room to go take a Bottle of Wine. \n\nIn itself, the alliance between Botha and Viljoen already existed, and the meeting was organized for pure formality... After a few minutes, the man comes back into the room with a bottle of red wine and two glasses, into which he pours it. \n\n"Ah, Thank You... Mister Viljoen, let me pour it for you." \n\nBotha says with a beaming smile as he hands the Glass to Viljoen. \n\n"Very kind of you…" \n\nSays Viljoen, even more suspicious of his Intentions, but despite this, he takes a sip from his glass.\n\n"This meeting went well, how about making a toast?" \n\n"A Toast to our Alliance?" \n\nViljoen asks, in an almost stupid way for the other men in the room, as he expects a completely different answer. \n\n"No, A toast to our Friendship Meneer Viljoen!""

Junta Loyalists are criticizing Viljoen's lack of care for this situation, in fact, he is very convinced, along with the majority of supporters of Apartheid that "Der Groote Krokodrill" P.W.

Until Botha breaks his silence, I stand by his side. \n\n"Viljoen, come on, lower your weapons, let's not start a Slaughter." \n\nBotha tells him, very confidently. \n\n"What the fuck do you think you're doing!? I thought we were allies!" \n\nViljoen tells him, keeping the weapon pointed at him... \n\nI feel like the inevitable is about to happen...God help me please…\n\nBotha answers him very sure of himself…\n\n"This is Politics old chap, friends betray...

Go." \n\nBotha answers him, always keeping that fucking smile on his face... And after that... Viljoen and his men exit the Room.  \n\n\n11:21 AM. \n\nThis Plan is over... Thank goodness. Botha, he got what he wanted, and I didn't have to kill anyone... I don't know if today I would have had the strength to do it…\n\nI'm Just glad this thing is over... "
