Being a successful drama writer and a government agent once. He was one of the founding members of the MDF, the party that once led the nation into its freedom after the fall of Communism in Hungary. He was locked out of the MDF after numerous controversies due to his radical opinions. After getting locked out of the party he once co-founded, he founded his own party, the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, an ultranationalist party that once seemed to be forever stuck in irrelevance. However, after the social democrats won the 1994 elections and re-established some trade and cooperation with the Soviets, the far right along with multiple other parties became furious. Csurka capitalized on this and led a coup which put MIÉP at power. With his power consolidated in the last 6 years. Now he sits at his throne in the Parliament building, thinking about his next move."
