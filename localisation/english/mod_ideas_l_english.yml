It is important to note however that our economy is not a carbon copy of China’s Dengist model, we still hold deep the aspects of Stalin's industrialist and collectivist approach which will likely take years to phase out.

China takes pride in the two significant leaps in the development of its ideological framework:\n\n§RFirst Leap: Incorporation of Mao Zedong Thought§!\nIn 1945, during the 7th Party Congress, Mao Zedong Thought was incorporated into the Party's Constitution, becoming the guiding ideology alongside Marxism-Leninism: "Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought."

However, these two agencies operate with a high degree of independence and are not subordinate to the Central Committee of the Party. Other departments, such as the propaganda department, united front committee, international liaison department, economic and financial department, all fall under the authority of the Central Committee of the Communist Party.\n\nNotably, the Central Military Commission plays a highly independent role, highlighting the unique position of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Chinese politics. The positions of general secretary or president do not hold authority over the Chinese military. The Chairman of the Military Commission serves as the supreme military leader of the Party and State. Currently, the role of the chairman of the military commission may not be prominently displayed, but this position has the potential to wield absolute power if separated. Such separation becomes necessary when the political system experiences weakness, instability, and internal disagreements within the Party. In such cases, the Chinese military, under independent leadership, can take charge, quell disagreements, and deter opposing opinions. This was evident during the post-Cultural Revolution to the reform and opening-up period from 1976 to 1995.\n\nHowever, the granting of numerous privileges to military generals resulted in various negative consequences in the coming future."

In the new millennium, as the world has become even more complex and unpredictable, the Finnish government has remained committed to this policy of neutrality. Our neutrality is a symbol of our determination to chart our own course in a world that is dominated by larger and powerful nations. Despite the challenges that come with staying neutral in a world of shifting alliances and geopolitical tensions, we should take pride in our ability to maintain our independence and to avoid getting drawn into conflicts that are not our own. Of course, the commitment to neutrality comes with its own set of challenges. Many Finns worry about the potential threats that loom on the horizon, and there is always that sense of unease about the country's ability to defend itself against any potential aggressors."

 RAJ_the_southern_revolutionaries_idea_name:0 "The Southern Revolutionaries"
 RAJ_the_southern_revolutionaries_idea_name_desc:0 "In the southern India, a number of significant revolutionary movements emerged, each challenging the established socio-political order. Of particular prominence was the Naxalite movement, deeply rooted in Maoist ideology, which found its operational epicenters in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, and parts of Odisha. These groups espoused the objective of toppling the Indian government through armed insurgency, with the ultimate aim of establishing a communist state.\n\nThe People's War Group (PWG), a leading faction within the Naxalite spectrum, earned notoriety for its radical ideology and its proclivity for employing violent methods, chiefly in the state of Andhra Pradesh. In parallel, the southern state of Tamil Nadu harbored connections and sympathizers of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), even though the LTTE's central locus of operations was located in Sri Lanka. This state of affairs prompted the Indian government to undertake measures aimed at curbing LTTE activities within Tamil Nadu.\n\nFurthermore, the new millennium bore witness to the persistent ethnic conflicts in Northeast India, notably involving groups such as the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB). These insurgent entities continued to engage in acts of armed rebellion, thereby contributing to the overarching security quandary that the Indian government confronted during this temporal epoch.\n\nThese movements, as a common modus operandi, routinely resorted to strategies encompassing armed confrontations, bombings, and the orchestration of guerrilla warfare. Consequently, they presented formidable challenges to the maintenance of law and order and the preservation of regional stability."

 RAJ_parliment_split_idea_name:0 "Parliment Split"
 RAJ_parliment_split_idea_name_desc:0 "The Parliament Split in India refers to a significant political event that occurred during the tenure of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The split emerged within the ruling coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which was led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A key ally of the NDA, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), withdrew its support over differences regarding the handling of the issue of separate statehood for the state of Andhra Pradesh. This withdrawal of support led to the NDA losing its majority in the Parliament.\n\nThe split created a political upheaval and forced the BJP-led government to seek a vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of India's Parliament). In a highly debated and closely watched event, the government faced the confidence vote, which ultimately led to its survival with a narrow margin. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Manohar Joshi, played a crucial role in conducting the vote and ensuring its legitimacy.\n\nDespite the government's survival, the split highlighted the challenges of coalition politics in India, where regional parties often wield significant influence. It demonstrated the importance of strategic maneuvering and negotiation within political alliances. The Parliament Split underscored the complexities of governance in a diverse and multi-party democracy like India, where balancing various regional and ideological interests is a constant endeavor."

 RAJ_neverending_military_spending_idea_name:0 "Neverending Military Spending"
 RAJ_neverending_military_spending_idea_name_desc:0 "India experienced a notable pattern of sustained military spending  due to its consistent allocation of resources to defense expenditures. India faced a combination of security challenges, regional tensions, and modernization needs that contributed to its ongoing investment in the military sector.\n\nThe heightened security concerns arising from regional conflicts and the evolving geopolitical landscape led India to maintain a robust defense posture. Tensions with neighboring Pakistan, especially in the context of the ongoing Kashmir dispute, played a significant role in shaping India's defense priorities. Additionally, the nuclear tests conducted by both India and Pakistan in the late 1990s further emphasized the importance of maintaining a credible deterrence capability.\n\nThe need to modernize the armed forces and keep pace with technological advancements also drove continuous military spending. As global military technologies started evolving, India sought to enhance its capabilities through the acquisition of advanced weaponry, equipment, and infrastructure. This modernization effort aimed to bolster India's defense capabilities, improve its strategic reach, and enhance its ability to respond to a range of security challenges."

 RAJ_caste_system_idea_name:0 "Caste System"
 RAJ_caste_system_idea_name_desc:0 "The caste system in India remained a deeply entrenched societal structure. This ancient system categorized individuals into distinct groups based on birth, occupation, and social standing. The four primary varnas, or caste categories, included Brahmins (priests and scholars), Kshatriyas (warriors and rulers), Vaishyas (merchants and farmers), and Shudras (laborers). Below these varnas, the Dalits, historically known as "untouchables," occupied a marginalized position.\n\nDespite legal measures, discrimination against lower-caste individuals, particularly Dalits, continued to persist across various facets of life, encompassing education, employment, and access to public amenities. The practice of untouchability, which mandated the segregation and ostracization of Dalits, remained prevalent in certain regions.\n\nThe Indian government had implemented affirmative action policies during this time, referred to as reservations which reserved a portion of seats in educational institutions and positions in the government for Scheduled Castes (Dalits) and Scheduled Tribes, aiming to foster their inclusion and upliftment. Political parties often appealed to specific caste groups in their quest to secure votes, leading to the formation of caste-based alliances and political movements.\n\nThe Indian Constitution provided legal safeguards against caste-based discrimination and untouchability. Laws like the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act were in place to deter violence and discrimination against marginalized communities. The caste system remained a complex and deeply rooted social issue in India, characterized by both enduring discrimination and the persistent efforts to promote social equality and justice."
